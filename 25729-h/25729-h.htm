&nbsp;As soon as they step into my house and see my strange
collection of travel keepsakes, all visitors&rsquo; eyes are drawn
to the Arabian saddle, which actually deserves credit as the
inspiration and author of this story. It has Oriental-red velvet,
richly decorated with gold embroidery. This Pasha saddle was fit
for a tribal Turkish chieftain, having comfortable stirrups and an
accompanying dreadful bit that could conquer the stubborn
resistance of even the mightiest horse.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My magnificent saddle was a present from Mustafa [Mohammed]
Bustani, a wealthy merchant and friend who worked equally well with
Arabs and Jews. His shop is on the right hand side of the
Marketplace El Bizar, along the way to the third most sacred
Islamic mosque, Harem Esh Sheriff, where the Israelite King
Solomon&rsquo;s Temple earlier stood. Try to understand the nature
of <u>Judaraber</u>, these Arabs of the Holy Land who now live
side-by-side with Jews. Little by little, they have given up their
handed down-hatred against Hebrews, for they share the strict Old
Testament views of &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Chosen People.&rdquo; In this
way, <u>Judaraber</u> are more inclined to think like Semites and
less like those in Christendom.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With these Muslims, it is no more of a disgrace to become a
Christian as to convert to Judaism. Anyway, this unique perspective
only concerns inner opinions; especially regarding personal matters
or simple business transactions, this peculiar outlook has hardly
any influence. So, I was Mustafa Bustanis&rsquo; friend, in spite
of religious differences, just because we liked each other. When I
bought things in Jerusalem, I purchased solely from him whenever
possible. I preferred to deal with him, not only as a merchant, but
much more as a good human being. He too knew this truth, and he
repaid me through our friendship&rsquo;s deep affection. I felt
that I possessed his complete trust and confidence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I often stopped by his store, even if I had no particular reason to
buy something. For many hours, we sat beside each other, reclining
against a broad, Persian carpet-covered crate as we endlessly drank
coffee that his African servant Bem prepared for us. We considered
ourselves to be like brothers; thereto, we felt no need to keep
secrets from each other. Every now and then, there were
distinguished customers that he permitted to interrupt us. His
assistant attended to them, even though he himself could have
waited on them. Habakek was the name of Mustafa&rsquo;s helper, an
exceptionally good-natured fellow&mdash;a delightful combination of
magician, jack-of-all-trades, and Renaissance man who could
accomplish anything that your eyes could imagine.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mustafa Bustani was a big fan of fairy tales. He loved to hear or
tell every kind of fairy tale&mdash;most of all, one which involved
a belief in miracles or a situation wherein the dead and the living
played a dynamic role. Yet in no way was he superstitious in the
general sense. On the contrary, he was an educated man who spoke
Arabic, Turkish, and Persian; with Westerners, he could reasonably
communicate in French and in English.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Concerning religious faith, he showed commendable tolerance;
however, earlier in life it was the opposite case. He had a brother
who was banished from the family, due to the fact that he had been
baptized as a Christian. Mustafa did not conceal this fact; at the
time, he had totally agreed with his exile.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In contrast to the past, he now seemed to think otherwise about
that banishment. In truth, I learned nothing more than that his
brother had moved to East Jordan; there he had married a Christian
woman. For that reason, all of the banned brother&rsquo;s attempts
at reconciliation had been rejected. Thereafter, he
vanished&mdash;yet, one knows all too well that family ties can
never be completely ripped apart.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When my friend spoke of his &ldquo;harem,&rdquo; he was using the
Semitic culture&rsquo;s exclusive, figurative reference to the
soul&rsquo;s most private and sacred sanctum. Therein, he seemed to
be inspired by more compassionate convictions which he had not yet
succeeded in shutting out. Harem? Yes, be certain that our mutually
respectful confidence in each other had risen so high that we quite
often did not avoid speaking of his or my
&ldquo;harem.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among Muslims, this open interchange is
actually forbidden. Namely, only my wife was permitted to
understand my most private sphere of thoughts, to know my
&ldquo;harem.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have no children. As for Mustafa&rsquo;s spiritually-reserved
harem, he confided in his wife, his eleven year old son, and in the
family&rsquo;s black female cook. The other household servants were
not included in this private circle of confidants. His son had the
short, yet very meaningful name of Thar, which Bavarians would
interpret as a &ldquo;dashing fellow.&rdquo; Unlike the
stereotypical, mistaken picture of Middle Eastern children, he was
not a somber, moody, overly serious, nor slow-moving child. From
the family&rsquo;s home which lay outside the inner city, this
delightfully mischievous boy often came to his father&rsquo;s
store. Whenever he met me, it seemed that he never tired of tossing
me the most unbelievable heaps of questions about all kinds of
matters concerning my homeland.&nbsp; From him, I learned the
latest news about his father&rsquo;s harem&mdash;every broken pot
and every captured mouse. In return for his youthful openness and
his high regard for me, he expected me to report all of my secrets
to him. Woe unto me if he ever believed that I failed to trust him
in this relationship.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the course of this friendly bond among father, son, and myself,
I was invited as a guest and had the opportunity to meet the
mother. I remember this well. I often spent entire evenings in the
home of Mustafa Bustani. When I last said good-bye, I promised to
bring along my wife on my next visit.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Nomen et [est] omen</u>&mdash; a name may predict one&rsquo;s
destiny. Within living memory of the Family Mustafa Bustanis, it
had always been a custom to have a family member by the name of
Thar. This stemmed from the family&rsquo;s bygone days as nomads.
Presently, Mustafa&rsquo;s boy was the bearer of this namesake, as
well as its legacy. Night and day, he tried as hard as he could to
be a credit to his name. The name &ldquo;Thar&rdquo; means
vengeance, retaliation, retribution, and a blood feud. This is the
old, dreadful law which calls for the following: &ldquo;Blood for
blood! An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth!&rdquo; &nbsp;In
ancient times, among certain primitive folk and also nowadays, some
have felt that there are reasons to retaliate. Under civilized
conditions, it&rsquo;s not only reprehensible and
criminal&mdash;it&rsquo;s just ridiculously laughable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ever since Thar became aware of his name&rsquo;s notoriety, he
thoroughly came under the influence of his own imagination.
Therein, he always contemplated some kind of recompense&mdash;and
if none existed, he thought one up. In everything that he heard or
saw, these events had to serve as a design for payback that stemmed
from some past injury. Unfortunately, he didn&rsquo;t always find
the heroic acclaim that he anticipated. His destiny misunderstood
him. Instead of the planned retribution that was meant to achieve
its intended, costly purpose, there was always a dumb turn of
events in the end, which placed the boy himself in an unfavorable
position. At this point, he inevitably found himself on the
receiving end of retribution; thereto, he himself would be harmed
by his own campaign. Even so, this reversal of roles did not hold
him back; he remained true to his name and to his calling. Always
and again, Thar was ready to make a fresh start.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To these preliminary notes, I add the fact that I had traveled from
Sumatra to Egypt; I was supposed to meet my wife in Jerusalem. I
had guided her through the Land of the Pharaohs and through the
Arabian Desert; now, we found ourselves in the Promised Land.
Yesterday, we arrived in Jerusalem by way of the Jaffa Gate. We
wanted to stay a few weeks in order to take some regional side
trips that included a visit to the Dead Sea. Next, we wanted to
head towards Damascus. For travel purposes, we needed two saddles,
one for a man and one for a woman. Automatically and without
question, I contacted my friend Mustafa, for no one else could get
everything that we needed. My wife accompanied me. Given my
previous accounts concerning my spouse, Mustafa and his household
seemed to know her almost as well as they knew me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Even though he was a noble, Middle Eastern educated man, Mustafa
erred at times in the upbringing of his young son. By way of
comparison, his wife&rsquo;s disposition was exceptionally lively,
loving, and kind. Seeing both parents&rsquo; character traits come
together in their child, the boy took on his mother&rsquo;s
cheerful, joking nature and his father&rsquo;s very deadpan humor;
thus, Thar almost always had the disposition to tease his dad, his
mom, and the whole world.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We went through the Jaffa Gate, towards the Marketplace El Bizar,
and there we found Mustafa. He didn&rsquo;t notice us right away,
because he was involved in playing a trick on a customer who wanted
to buy a new turban. In the middle of the shop, there stood a
camel&mdash;which actually was his helper, Habakek. He had
positioned himself on all fours and had adorned his disguise
exactly like a camel that you see in a parade, having head bands
jingling with ornaments and feathered plumes. The forelegs had a
string of bells; draped over the costumed camel&rsquo;s sides was a
gaudy, glass-beaded wool netting. To the rear, there was a
kid-leather water bottle which one would need in the desert. Nearby
stood Thar, dressed only in an over-sized, common blue shirt that
sagged loosely from his elbows to his knees. The boy&rsquo;s face,
arms, and legs were painted palm bark-brown.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Just as we entered the shop, the boy called out to their African
servant Bem, who was squatting near the room&rsquo;s coffee-corner:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Bedouin Sheik, and I&rsquo;m feeding my
camel!&rdquo; At that moment, he scooped up a handful of lettuce
leaves which the next door shopkeeper had previously thrown into
the street. He shoved the soiled greens into the submissively open
mouth of the make-believe camel. Habakek loudly, deliberately, and
delightedly chewed the fodder. You would have thought that this
creature was just an ordinary dromedary&mdash; a downright
authentic camel. Just by the way he behaved, one could not tell
that this was Habakek. Due to the fact that his face was so
completely painted with colorful crosses and dashes, he seemed to
disappear beneath all that makeup. For that reason, Bem questioned
Thar:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why then have you painted him up?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thar readily resounded:&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? This is
the hide that I&rsquo;ve painted. As you know, a camel has hairs on
its face!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to this scene, we took note of the richly
decorated donkey that stood in front of the neighboring store. In
no way was this animal&rsquo;s owner a commoner. The donkey&rsquo;s
important master had dismounted and stepped inside to buy
something.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;For the first time, the African saw me. At the moment, he was
busy grinding coffee beans with a mortar and pestle. He was so
overwhelmingly surprised that he tossed aside the coffee and the
mortar and let out a piercing whoop of joy. Consequently, all of
the others now drew their attention to me. Mustafa Bustani was so
surprised to see me suddenly in front of him, that he stood
completely still and said nothing. So much more in tune to the
situation, Thar happily leaped in the air, let out a triumphant
cheer, pointed to my wife, and asked: &ldquo;Is this she, the woman
whom you promised to bring to us?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, it is she,&rdquo; I answered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>He bowed
three times before her and beckoned towards the camel:
&ldquo;Please sit upon this; it&rsquo;s bejeweled for
you!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
All at once, the camel stood up on its hind legs and used its hands
to wipe the fur from its face: &ldquo;I have no more time for this!
I need to attend to the store&rsquo;s business!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As he happily greeted my wife and me, he tossed off the
camel-costume jewelry and devoted his attention to the customer
whom Mustafa had left to his own devices. Mustafa&rsquo;s joy was
as great as it was genuine. He greeted me with the customary
bows&nbsp; and pulled me close to his heart: &ldquo;What a comfort
to see you today! Give thanks to Allah. Dearest friend, sit down
with me; you know that you&rsquo;re always welcome
here!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mustafa then bowed three times to my wife; but as he tried to speak
to her, his voice broke down, and tears burst from his eyes. He
placed both hands to his face and softly sobbed. Thar cried too,
gripping the pleat of my wife&rsquo;s white traveling dress. He
then wiped away his tears and rubbed off the Bedouin-brown paint
from his face and arms as he offered her the following explanation:
&ldquo;He weeps today, because you&rsquo;re here now&mdash;yet, she
can&rsquo;t see you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why is she unable to see me?&rdquo; my wife asked, although
she intuitively guessed that he meant his mother.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She is dead.
Didn&rsquo;t you know this?&rdquo; he answered. We were both
startled. There simply were no adequate words; yet the boy
continued on: &ldquo;She so much looked forward to seeing you,
because your Effendi [Turkish title for a noble man] whom we all
love, had sung your praises. Unlike other men who talk about their
harems and always complain about the wife, in truth, he never said
a mean word about you. He and my father consistently refrain from
that. The sickness came and closed her eyes. &nbsp;I personally
witnessed this. They carried her away. Whenever he thinks about
her, my father continually cries. As for me, almost all of my days
must be filled with devising a new avenging-quest&mdash;which makes
my father laugh again. However, he no longer laughs, nor does he
have the will to fight. All of this is so wrong!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the close of his words, he let his eyes wander throughout the
shop. There he focused on the customer who had taken off his round
turban-skullcap, placing it aside as he tried on a tasseled fez. In
the Middle East, such a flat-crowned hat has long been associated
with many speeches and counter arguments. His head was completely
bald, glistening a slippery-bright, as if it were waxed and shined.
It was just forty-five minutes ago that Thar had happily worn his
theatrical makeup. Across his newly-wiped face, there now streaked
a prankish thought which he put into action: &ldquo;Hold on;
another avenging plot is coming to me. Please don&rsquo;t disrupt
me; simply look over there&mdash;where &nbsp;presently I&rsquo;m
not!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He wriggled towards the store&rsquo;s back corner, where they kept
all kinds of gadgets, including the stove for cooking coffee. Back
there was also the African&rsquo;s space which he had left in order
to fetch a couple of fluffy bales of material, a piece of carpet,
and a divan for my wife. To overcome his grieving, Mustafa Bustani
helped Bem with these tasks; he was not aware that his son had told
us about his difficult mourning. When the divan was ready, we sat
down. Accustomed to our earlier times together, I took my place on
the crate with the Turkish water-pipe nearby. If we hadn&rsquo;t
learned earlier about the death of his wife, our conversation
normally would have begun. The words simply did not want to come
forth. Blessedly, the shop gave rise to somewhat of a stopgap.
Unfortunately, Mustafa Bustani&rsquo;s inventory did not include
saddles, so he invited us to return tomorrow. In the meantime, he
planned to fulfill all of our requests.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At this point, the shopper interrupted us; he was a country
gentleman from Ain Kahrim<b>,</b> the birthplace of John the
Baptist. He had put on his old cap again, along with his headscarf.
Then, he pointed to the new items that he had selected, wanting to
know the price of the fez and a colorful turban-cloth. In the
Middle East, such a minor transaction normally doesn&rsquo;t
proceed quickly. However, in order to send the customer on his way,
Mustafa gave him the price so fast that the buyer paid his money
without reservation and hastily exited.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This disruption now had the effect of reclaiming more life in our
conversation. Among ourselves, we sensed that something on both
sides had transpired in that time&mdash;something which we had not
seen. In the process, Mustafa had seized every opportunity to bring
Thar back, all in order to praise him. We had not been speaking
softly, so the boy must have been able to hear us. Thar was
crouched down in the corner by Bem, and it seemed that they were
undertaking a change of scenes, which for now was concealed from
us. In the way of materials for transforming a setting,
Mustafa&rsquo;s shop lacked nothing; for almost everything
imaginable was available for purchase, old as well as new. After
the boy and Bem had completed their grand scheme, Thar slowly came
striding out of the corner, proudly presenting himself to
us.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was now dressed as a famous hero, most likely ready to perform
some kind of vendetta gain. Half of a clay water-crock served as
his helmet, one that probably had been dug up and broken in the
process. His breastplate consisted of a tin lamp shade, the kind
that one places upright in front of the light. Onto his bare
calves, he had fastened two gigantic knight&rsquo;s spurs, which
possibly dated back to the medieval days of the Crusades. Into his
rope-belt, he stuck the most outrageous weapons that one can
imagine: three knives, two pairs of scissors, two corkscrews, and
four candle-snuffers&mdash;all of which were arranged around his
waist. Besides these, he added a mousetrap, a bow with quiver and
arrows, and some left-over items which he carried in his hand: a
corn-cutting sickle, a saber&rsquo;s sheath, and a shotgun barrel.
His war paint consisted of two colors, precisely creating the exact
impression that he intended. The right arm and the left leg were
painted green; the left arm and the right leg were blue. On both
cheeks and for a moustache, this skin too was blue. His chin had a
grass-green hue. We laughed, as did Mustafa Bustani.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well then, who are you?&rdquo; Mustafa asked the armed
figure.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As he rattled all of his weapons, Thar answered in a battlefield
tone: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Gideon, the hero.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ever and always, he only takes his heroes from the Old
Testament,&rdquo; his father explained. Turning to his son, he
continued: &ldquo;What is Gideon planning to do?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have slain Baal&rsquo;s priests in order to destroy the
Midianites!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Newer and more intense saber rattling! Unfortunately, it was
impossible to learn anything more about his valiant purpose,
because the scene was interrupted by the man from Ain Kahrim. At
this moment, he came running back to the shop. Clearly in an urgent
tizzy, this episode seemed to raise the man&rsquo;s agitation to
its highest level. At first, he spoke so rapidly and indignantly
that he could hardly be understood. We could only discern the words
&ldquo;fez &ndash; turban &ndash; barber &ndash; head &ndash; blue
&ndash; soap &ndash; water &ndash; shame and
disgrace!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After we persuaded him to explain everything calmly and slowly, he
did so; thus, we learned that he had been to the barber, just as
he&rsquo;s accustomed whenever he comes to the city. For him, it
was normal to see to the grooming of his beard and head, for this
cleanliness of the head is prescribed by the Prophet Mohammed. This
rite should only be performed by a licensed barber, not by any
other man.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When he bared his head, all those present in the barber shop roared
with laughter; for the hair of this old-timer was no longer white
as usual. Instead, it had turned blue as the sky. As it turned out,
the blue stain came from his headgear, which he had taken off at
the barber&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Secretly, someone had poured blue dye
into the hat. The barber had done his best to wash away the
coloring, yet this had only made matters worse. The addition of
water simply dispersed the heavens-blue pigment, which now more
permanently corroded still deeper into his scalp. As he removed his
skullcap and head scarf, he called out: &ldquo;Allah have mercy!
Here, look at me! Let the culprit step forward so that I can punish
him!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
An entirely hairless skull of glistening heavens-blue hue? Include
the fact that the man was not wearing the new fez; instead, he had
again plopped the soiled cap on his head. One could hardly resist
the giggles that came with the sight of this angry man. My wife was
the first to burst out laughing. She found it impossible to
restrain herself. The African Bem followed, then Habakek, and
finally Mustafa and I. The hearty peal of laughter had a strange
effect; instead of increasing the anger of this man from Ain
Kahrim, it seemed to subdue him, probably through his own
perception of his ridiculous appearance. Only the boy was not
laughing. No train of thought stirred across his face. He stepped
up to the man, loudly and seriously confessing: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
the one!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You?&rdquo; the astonished man asked. &ldquo;How can a child
dare to do this, to insult the bare head of a
Moslem!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t uncover it! I did it as a justified payback,
all in order for you to know that my name is
Thar.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thar?&rdquo; responded the bewildered man.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, Thar! Didn&rsquo;t you yourself say that a believer may
only allow a barber to bare his head? Yet you have uncovered it
here, and you even showed it to us! For this offense, I&rsquo;ve
punished you; I poured blue-retaliation upon your head&rsquo;s
uncovered hull.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the utmost astonishment, the blue-headed man asked us:
&ldquo;Is something like this possible? According to this boy,
I&rsquo;m the one who should be punished&mdash;not he! What does
his father say about this?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mustafa would have answered the question, as best he could, but the
boy spoke first: &ldquo;If you require a father here, then fetch
your own; for you may not borrow mine! I&rsquo;m Gideon, the Hero
of Manasseh. Good-bye!&rdquo; In a dignified way, Thar nodded to
the man, then proudly strode out of the shop. Still clad in his
make-shift suit of armor, he climbed onto the stranger&rsquo;s
donkey that was standing outside. From there, he trotted away on
the animal. Everyone knows this: at a very young age, all Arabic
boys regard the back of a donkey as the best of all playgrounds. It
is rare to find a boy who lacks the courage to ride.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Now, the man from Ain Kahrim really didn&rsquo;t know what he was
supposed to think. His mouth hung open. Without saying a word, he
glanced towards the spot where he last saw the boy. Speaking in
German and still laughing, my wife asked me: &ldquo;Is this
possible?&rdquo; I had no time to answer her. The scene had
changed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The owner of the donkey was mostly concerned about the distance
between him and his animal. He had figured out whom the strangely
outfitted boy belonged to; from the neighboring shop, he now walked
over to us. Whether by civil means or through a complaint to the
police, he was determined to come closer to settling matters.
&ldquo;Who among you is Mustafa Bustani?&rdquo; he
inquired.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As my friend slid off the trunk and bowed low, he answered:
&ldquo;I.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you know me?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes. Who wouldn&rsquo;t know you? You are Osman Achyr, the
Ferik-Pasha of our Sovereign. May Allah bless
him!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your son has stolen my donkey!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;He has not stolen the animal&mdash;just borrowed it. Thar
will bring it back safe again!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do I run a rent-a-donkey business? If I did, I would expect
a person to ask me first!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I ask your pardon, sir!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By official title, this man&rsquo;s ranking was that of a general.
Even though he chose to wear unassuming, civilian clothes instead
of a uniform, he carried himself like a nobleman. Now that he had
to deal with yet one more infraction, he steadied his voice as he
renewed his dogged determination to assert his authority:
&ldquo;No, I do not excuse him. The boy has stolen from me, and he
has dishonored me. I demand that he be punished!&rdquo; The Pasha
now drew closer to Mustafa and asked: &ldquo;Who are you? In your
mind, what did he&mdash;?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the General saw the blue-skulled man, he halted in
mid-sentence&mdash; the Pasha&rsquo;s eyes began to glisten and
grow wider. Taking just the right amount of time to pause, the
Blue-one began to narrate the boy&rsquo;s misdeeds&mdash;but he
could go no further. Appealing to the stern General and to us, the
heavens-blue man now cracked up, laughing like we had done earlier.
His laughter was so contagious that we could not help but join him.
In the middle of our merriment, the boy came riding back with a
mass of children following him. The adults readily recognized him,
but they were no longer concerned about Thar&rsquo;s outlandish
pranks.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The boy brought the donkey back to the same spot where it formerly
stood. In the same way he had left us, he returned to us with the
same style of majestic dignity and seriousness. This made such an
irresistible impression upon all of us, that our laughter
momentarily turned to silence. Just as suddenly, it broke loose and
doubled its intensity, as if it never wanted to end. Laughing with
us too was the Blue-one. Once he began, he laughed the longest and
was the last to stop.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thar also recognized the General. Right away, he positioned himself
directly in front of him, smartly stood at attention, then sharply
saluted just like he had seen soldiers whenever they met an
officer. The Pasha then asked him: &ldquo;Do you know who I
am&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then who am I?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are Benaja, the
Commander-in-chief of King Solomon&rsquo;s army!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The General laughed: &ldquo;Bravo! You&rsquo;re still playing your
role. What are your weapons for?&rdquo; The Pasha pointed to the
scissors, corkscrew, and candle-snuffers. However, the boy was not
ready to step out of character. His mouth still contained countless
numbers of stories.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Better than any German boy&rsquo;s knowledge of his home
city&rsquo;s chronicles, Thar knew all the legends and tall tales
of Jerusalem&rsquo;s past. He was even consciously aware of his
weapons&rsquo; symbolism. He quickly answered, taking no time to
reflect: &ldquo;These are the &lsquo;Scorpions&rsquo; wherewith the
King of Judah pinched and pulled the ears of the people whenever
they didn&rsquo;t want to obey him. I&rsquo;m Gideon, the hero who
hails from my ancestors of Manasseh. I borrowed your warhorse
because I needed your steed to carry out my vendetta against the
Midianites, the sons of Abraham. Your mount is too fat and has no
endurance; so for this reason, I turned around and brought him back
to you. I appreciate your loaning him to me, but he is really of no
use.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thar repeated his salute. The Pasha laughed so hard that tears
streamed from his eyes. Without question, he seemed to be a very
congenial gentleman. Mustafa hurriedly capitalized on the
Pasha&rsquo;s good mood and seeming willingness to forego
punishment of his son: &ldquo;For what he has done, please forgive
him! He&rsquo;s exceptionally bright and greatly gifted.&rdquo; Yet
his words accomplished just the opposite of what he had intended.
In a flash, the face of the Pasha became serious again, almost
threatening: &ldquo;No speech of yours can gain the boy&rsquo;s
pardon. Your son has doubly transgressed&mdash; against me and
against him over there.&rdquo; The Pasha pointed towards the man
from Ain Kahrim: &ldquo;For this, he deserves punishment instead of
a reward; and by my own hand, I will personally administer his
whipping. Is there a switch nearby which suits this
purpose?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The African Bem heard this request. From his corner of the room, he
brought out a thin, knobby walking-stick which had been used for
all kinds of educational procedures. When the boy saw this, he
began to talk&mdash; instead of prudently staying silent. The
General grabbed the cane and air-lashed it several times as he
tested it to and fro. Satisfied with the reed, the Pasha nodded his
head and slyly squinted his eyes as he looked sideways at the boy:
&ldquo;Of course, you understand that your offenses will be
punished?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thar nodded and quickly answered: &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Should I then pronounce judgment by using your given
name?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And also carry out the punishment in your
name?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;So be it. By my own hand, the boy shall receive ten blows:
five for injuries to me and five for you!&rdquo; The General
pointed to the blue-headed man from Ain Kahrim.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Disappointedly, the man asked: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that too
few?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Pasha snapped at him: &ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who receives this corporal punishment&mdash;you or
me?&rdquo; the boy asked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
deference to the Pasha, Thar turned and said: &ldquo;Surely you see
that this is neither too little nor too much. Are you serious in
your judgment of only ten lashes?&rdquo; The General confirmed his
decision: &ldquo;Yes. For Gideon, this is actually not a great
honor to be beaten with a cane!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The boy agreed: &ldquo;I think so too! However, I now have this
misfortune&mdash;not merely to retaliate once, but to collect
vengeance again! So I plead with you; at least grant me permission
to put aside my hero&rsquo;s garb.&rdquo; His wish was granted, so
he made his exit to the coffee-corner. He took off his
warrior-weaponry, then returned in order to get on with the
improvised administration of justice.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hold him!&rdquo; the Pasha commanded the father. Mustafa
obeyed. In the manner that all readers know full well, the father
leaned forward, stuck out his left knee, and placed the
Guardian-of-Blood-Feuds across his lap, thereby causing the back
side of the Transgressor to be exposed. Without saying a word and
without struggling, Thar allowed all this to happen. The Pasha
positioned himself, took a swing with the cane, and counted the
strokes: &ldquo;One&mdash;two.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He continued no further. The execution could not go forward,
because my wife had sprung from her chair, placed herself squarely
between the competitors, and appealed for mercy. The Pasha asked
who she was. She told him. For a moment, he reflected, then bowed
to her and replied that he would grant her request&mdash;but not
before the count of ten which he had dictated. Under all
circumstances, he was obligated to uphold his word; therefore, he
was unable to rescind his order. Admittedly, he could not mitigate
the two strokes that he had already given. In regard to the
outstanding eight which she now wished to administer, and rightly
so, the Pasha would grant her heart&rsquo;s desire.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At this point, he handed her the cane, stepped back, and beckoned
her to proceed. Since we were all in sympathy with the Delinquent,
we were pleased that she accepted his offer. When she turned
towards the Pasha, she no longer saw him. In the meantime, he had
gone back to the shop next door. Just when the man from Ain Kahrim
prepared to lodge his objection to a lighter sentence, Mustafa
Bustani invited him to come back in one hour and pick out a present
for himself. With just a few more words here and there, the
gentleman left, for the time being.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the boy whispered so that his father would not hear him:
&ldquo;He laughed&mdash; oh how he laughed! Did you see it? Oh how
that makes me happy!&rdquo; His good-hearted, loving-eyes lit up.
Then he kissed my wife&rsquo;s hand and said: &ldquo;I thank you
for the &lsquo;eight&rsquo; which you have given me. They were
tender and mild as pepperless home-baked cookies. For this,
I&rsquo;ll never forget you. As you know, I&rsquo;m a hero.
Whenever you&rsquo;re in need, please call on me to rescue
you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On this note, Thar once again withdrew to the coffee-corner. With
the help of African Bem, he somehow managed to change into a new
outfit. His father once more took his place upon the crate in order
to pick up the conversation where we had left off. Laughingly, he
closed the matter with words about his darling Trickster&rsquo;s
capers: &ldquo;He was his mother&rsquo;s &lsquo;chosen one.&rsquo;
She saw everything in him! Whether the Pasha wants to believe it or
not, he really is greatly gifted.&rdquo; I wanted to know how the
boy had acquired his strange love for colors: &ldquo;Was it also
present in his childhood?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mustafa answered: &ldquo;No. Understand that my Coffee Helper Bem
and my dark-skinned cook are a married couple. For some time, their
own young son has apprenticed himself to a whitewashing craftsman.
With their help, my son has developed a lively interest in the
multi-faceted kingdom of colors. It seems to me that he was born to
be an artist. At first, we of course saw only the beginnings; but
they soon became so evident that I began to think that my lovely
revenue-earning store must have been seized by alien hands.
According to Islam, the human body should not be illustrated nor
copied. Yet for Thar and his sense of artistry, he sees how life
holds such majesty and beauty&mdash; it seems to invite him to
become a famous and honored painter. Among all of my acquaintances,
they believe that something of great consequence has been planted
within him. Is it not my duty to help him become a great
man?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t speak softly, so the boy
heard every word. As a result of this, Thar came out of his corner
and said to me:&nbsp; &ldquo;Effendi, you need to hear the whole
story; my father is not fully informing you. Namely, it&rsquo;s
this way:&nbsp; my Father says that I was &lsquo;most
favored&rsquo; by my Mother. In every way, she wanted to take care
of me. She knew that I had talent, so she was confident that one
day I would become a great artist. On the other hand, here is what
Mother always said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Father&rsquo;s favorite. In
all things, he looks after me.&nbsp; Still, he has the talents of
valiant heroes, and he shall become a great man.&rsquo; When I
attend school and listen to my teacher, he constantly says that
I&rsquo;m the &lsquo;chosen one&rsquo; of my Father, of My mother,
and of all my relatives;&nbsp; they follow everything I do.&nbsp;
According to my teacher, I don&rsquo;t have the slightest amount of
talent ever to become a great man&mdash;my prospects are surely
limited to that of working in commerce, playing chess, and hatching
hoaxes. So now you know, Effendi.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He said this so seriously. Truly, this was an earnest matter. Not
only that, it was infinitely important. His father had no idea
about the depth of meaning which lay in this child&rsquo;s honest
words. However, my wife perceived the truth in what he said,
because she looked at me and knowingly nodded.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the meantime, the boy had changed his external
appearance&mdash;not only in the way of colors, but even in
relation to their arrangement. That which earlier had been green,
now was blue, and what was once blue became green. The right leg,
the left arm, and both cheeks were now green. His left leg, right
arm, upper lip, and twisted-moustache were blue. Seeing this, I
asked myself: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He answered promptly:&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Judas Maccabees, and I
have a vendetta against the Syrians. I&rsquo;ll let that go for the
time being, because I&rsquo;ve heard what my Father said about me.
I&rsquo;ve told you what he thinks about me, how my Mother once
thought of me, and the teacher&rsquo;s assessment of me. Now, I
would also like to know your point of view, Effendi. First of all,
please tell me your opinion about all this. Who&rsquo;s right?
Father, Mother, or the teacher?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As if to ask forgiveness, he blushed and cast a pleading glance
toward his father when he answered his own question:&nbsp; &ldquo;I
love my Father and my Mother, but they&rsquo;re both mistaken. I
have no affection for my teacher, but he&rsquo;s right.&rdquo; I
was unable to respond&mdash;I could only pull the boy to my side
and kiss him on his unpainted forehead. My heart wanted to
overflow, and I also saw how deeply my wife was moved&mdash;her
eyes filled with tears. It was nothing short of a sacred moment.
All the while, his father sat next to me. Mustafa smiled at us, and
yet he didn&rsquo;t have the slightest notion about the depth of
innocence, the pure candor, and the spell-binding magic of the
child&rsquo;s soul which had become so palpably open to us.
&ldquo;So, give me a little time, Thar. When we see each other
again, you&rsquo;ll be different than you were previously. On that
date, I&rsquo;ll form my opinion of you. Before I leave Jerusalem,
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;Yes, really,&rdquo; I
answered. At that moment, his hand gently and tenderly touched my
cheekbone as he solemnly declared: &ldquo;Make no mistake; I also
love you. This I know for sure. Do you want to see something that
I&rsquo;ve created, that I&rsquo;ve actually painted?&rdquo; I said
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When are you coming again?&rdquo; I responded,
&ldquo;Tomorrow at the same time.&rdquo; He quickly chimed in:
&ldquo;Well then, before noon. I must begin my work and finish the
pictures this afternoon!&rdquo; He thought for a couple of moments.
A mischievous snicker quivered across his green cheeks and over his
blue moustache. Then he asked his father: &ldquo;May I have your
permission to redecorate the garden house today?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you want to do there?&rdquo; inquired Mustafa. Thar
answered:&nbsp; &ldquo;Paint two pictures; tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll
show them to Effendi.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good, you may.&rdquo; Thar insisted: &ldquo;But no one may
disturb me. Unless I so desire, no one will be allowed to come into
the garden house.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not even I?&rdquo; asked Mustafa. &ldquo;That includes
you,&rdquo; said Thar.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s certainly interesting. I hope that you will be
successful in showing Effendi something that&rsquo;s really good;
so, I have nothing against your project.&rdquo; The boy
exclaimed:&nbsp; &ldquo;Thanks be to Allah! I&rsquo;ll begin right
away!&rdquo; In joyful anticipation, he turned a somersault and
shot out of the shop. After a few minutes of silence, Mustafa
Bustani asked:&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, what do you say to him? What a
good lad! An artist, right?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; I
answered. First, let&rsquo;s see. Such judgments should be weighed
and regarded closely. I&rsquo;ve prayed for an extension of time.
Tomorrow will be the next time I see him.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This gave us the occasion to take our leave, so we parted company.
It was close to noon, when the hottest time of day begins and one
best spends time in the coolness of a room. When the heat was past,
we hiked towards the Mount of Olives in order to walk towards
Bethany, and then return back to Jerusalem via the sites of
Bethphage and Kafr et Tur. We took a photograph; my wife almost
never travels without a camera. Due to the fact that carrying
photography gear on a tour requires so much time and trouble,
I&rsquo;m always concerned that dealing with such things can
greatly interfere with my personal and natural mobility. Yet my
wife loves to bring home souvenir-photos that make her happy when
she reminisces later on. So today, she also took a couple of
pictures in Bethany; I&rsquo;ve included one of those, because it
shows the remnants of the city&rsquo;s stone wall. We climbed to
the summit of the Mount of Olives, upon which there are places
where you can see not only the mountains of East Jordan, but even a
part of the Dead Sea. As we enjoyed this rich view, we talked about
our visit with Mustafa Bustani. Contrasting his earlier, sad
appearance, we knew that the years would actually pass quickly as
he aged. The death of his wife had very deeply gripped him, which
another Muslim might be capable of handling otherwise.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add to this a
second, almost equally deep sorrow and inner-soul-excitement which
we were yet to discover. Up to this point, our attention had almost
exclusively been directed to the East; we now turned to the West,
to the city that lay before us. There in a secluded area near a
carob bush, we saw a man sitting with his hands folded as if in
prayer&mdash;staring motionless at the horizon. This was some time
before the shadows of evening. We were compelled to look at him.
When we came nearer, he stood up. It was our friend Mustafa
Bustani. We mentioned how we had just been talking about him.
However, he seemed to be self-conscious about our coincidental
meeting. It was as if he were feeling caught in the act of doing
something that no one was supposed to know about. His words, which
shut down after our greeting, sounded as though he felt that he had
a duty to apologize.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He told us how this
place has been his favorite spot for some time, one which he visits
daily as he looks towards the East. Instinctively, I had to think
about his missing, banished brother who had disappeared in the
East. We sat closely beside him and soon noticed that he thought it
necessary to speak in a peculiar frame of mind which had an
exceptionally soft-hearted undertone, one that gave the impression
of emotional helplessness. In our enormously scene-gripping,
surrounding locale, I didn&rsquo;t pry further. In his psyche, he
himself was used to doing a lot of soul-searching.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was right, for he
very soon directed the conversation to his previously mentioned
favorite subject, to the connection of the visible and invisible
world and to the biblical claim that there are in fact miracles.
Regarding this, he confessed to us that a dream drove him to this
conclusion, a dream that had been so certain and so clear that it
seemed he was awake and not sleeping at all. This clarity had been
so great and so convincing, that he had written down its exact
date: the 15<sup>th</sup> day of the Month of Adar. Half-way
apologizing and half-way questioning, he added that he would not
take on too much by being preoccupied with his dreams. We assured
him that all of us were greatly interested in everything that
concerned him, especially in matters of his spiritual
life.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&ldquo;Effendi, you know that my brother was cast out because
he had become a Christian, and that we all rejected his attempts to
reconcile, for he had even married a Christian woman. Ever since,
no one has heard from him. Later on, no one could find out where he
went. The events that followed even extended to our family&rsquo;s
inheritance. He had the very same rights as I had. I became the
sole heir; he was poor, poor as a beggar!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I tried to soften the harshness by noting customary laws and
governing families&rsquo; rights. He pointed this out to me:
&ldquo;You are a Christian and therefore think differently when you
try to make me feel better. For a full year, I felt no sense of
unfairness about what we had committed against him. After all,
possessions and religion are different matters, right? As a
believer, am I permitted to change the order of things whenever my
wealth changes to poverty? No! &nbsp;Even for such a little thing
as wanting to become a Christian and not remain a Muslim, one can
be pushed out of the family&rsquo;s circle of inheritance. However,
this last thought did not come from me; rather, it came from my
wife. In her heart, there lived a love and a kind-heartedness which
were not present in me. Her graciousness began a difficult and
heavy labor in me&mdash;but she succeeded. My hardness became
softer, always more tender; and when the mother of my son passed
away, she died as the victor. I promised her that I would search
for my brother and share with him everything that I own. She
thanked me, blessed me&mdash;then closed her eyes and
departed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He covered his face
with his hands and became silent for a while as he tried to master
his emotions; then, he continued: &ldquo;In vain, I searched and
searched. My brother had simply disappeared. Constantly, I thought
about him and even more about my wife, whose death had taken even
more away from me. Effendi, you probably know this already. This
question came to me: &lsquo;What if my brother had already died,
and he and my wife had found each other on the other side of this
life, where they now talked and looked below?&rsquo; I brooded over
such thoughts. I awoke with these ideas, and I fell asleep with
them.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;On the
15<sup>th</sup> day of the month of Adar, I dreamed that I was on
my knees, praying in the mosque. Opened before me was the First
Kiblah of the Holy Koran. My brother appeared to me and led me
forth, wanting to help me realize what he wanted to say to me:
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m dead, but I live. You have not pardoned me, but
I&rsquo;ve forgiven you. I&rsquo;ll send you my forgiveness. She
approaches from the East. Daily, keep a look-out for her and
restore again what you have perpetrated against me!&rsquo; His
words resounded. Then, he disappeared. The Koran closed itself, and
I awoke from the dream. This vision appeared to be so clear and so
true to me, that I left my store for the entire day in order to
ponder its meaning. Almost daily ever since, I am driven to come
here as I look towards the East to see whether the dream is being
fulfilled.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Regularly, I
sojourn for a short time in Bethany where I visit the grave of
Lazarus. Why? I don&rsquo;t know. For me, it&rsquo;s as if this is
the only place where I shall somehow meet with the messenger of my
brother. Effendi, what do you say about this
dream?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&ldquo;Listen to what you yourself are saying about your
brother. Truly, your own feelings can lead you better than any
separate perspective that I could give you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;So, do you think that I should continue to take my daily
walks to this place?&rdquo; I replied: &ldquo;Through someone or in
some way, will they forbid you to visit this site?&rdquo; He
answered, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; So I assured him, &ldquo;Well then,
there&rsquo;s no real reason for you to stop.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relieved, Mustafa
confided in me: &ldquo;I thank you. At first, it was hard for me to
tell you and your wife about these matters. Now that I&rsquo;ve
told you, I feel that my heart has grown much lighter. So, come!
Twilight is coming, and we must go&mdash;otherwise, the darkness
will overtake us on our way back.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stood up, and we
followed his example. He was right; the evening sank lower, so we
hurried towards home. Along the way, he told us how he had taken
care of some business for us. In Hebron, he had located an
expensive, Arabian Pasha-saddle which was for sale. He would send a
messenger to pick it up, then show the saddle to me. Just then, I
remembered: &ldquo;Oh yes, I personally must go towards Hebron. I
want to show my wife the Grave of Abraham, Abraham&rsquo;s Well,
and the famous Oak of Mamre, where the three angels appeared to the
Patriarch.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He happily called
out: &ldquo;So, if you&rsquo;ll permit me, I&rsquo;ll accompany
you. Since I have many important and pressing things to do there,
it would be best if we could travel tomorrow.&rdquo; I agreed:
&ldquo;Yes, we can do that. Any time that suits you is OK for
us.&rdquo; He seemed pleased: &ldquo;Really? Then tomorrow is OK?
And may I bring along my son Thar? It will be a real treat for him
to accompany you and me, riding in a beautiful carriage to see an
unknown part of the world. In that direction, he&rsquo;s never
traveled farther than Bethlehem.&rdquo; We were happy to oblige:
&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s OK with you, we have no objection to Thar
coming with us.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Good. So
it&rsquo;s decided that we&rsquo;ll make the trip; I&rsquo;ll make
the arrangements for a carriage. Since you&rsquo;re now on your way
to my home, please stay awhile longer at my house. I want you to
see the joy which your invitation will bring to my boy.&rdquo;
Before we reached our destination, it became completely dark.
Mustafa Bustani knocked on the inner gate&rsquo;s locked
door.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shuffling foot steps
drew near; the African cook opened the door for us. She had an
oriental wind-lantern in her hand. By its light, we saw that her
entire body had been wrapped in a white sheet, which now was so
full of blue, green, red, and yellow smudges, that we hardly
recognized its original surface.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the master of
the house saw her, he cried out: &ldquo;Maschallah! Look at
you!&rdquo; As she proudly answered, a most satisfied grin almost
doubled in size as it spread across her face: &ldquo;This is
art!&rdquo; Bewildered, Mustafa pressed further: &ldquo;Art? How
so?&rdquo; Maschallah replied: &ldquo;We are painting the Red Sea.
We began right after lunch, and we&rsquo;re still not quite
finished.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re painting too?&rdquo; he asked.
Certain, yet not exactly cheerful misgivings began to cross his
mind. In a tone that seemed to have greater and greater
self-satisfaction, she declared: &ldquo;Yes, I. The &lsquo;Favored
One&rsquo; is painting only the water, the air, and the sun; I,
however, paint the land green. Thar is not yet finished.&rdquo;
Mustafa quizzed further: &ldquo;The green land? Well then, what
does he paint on? Hopefully, only on paper.&rdquo; Maschallah
surprised him: &ldquo;Upon paper? Oh no. That would be much too
small. We&rsquo;re painting on the wall.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon the
wall? Where then?&rdquo; She answered: &ldquo;In the garden
house.&rdquo; Mustafa cried out: &ldquo;Allah, Allah! On the wall
in the garden house? That is outrageous! What will I see there? I
must go there immediately.&rdquo; He hurried away from the gate
where he had been standing all this time. At this moment, the cook
saw my wife and me. Her face lit up&nbsp; like a search light when
she recognized me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Effendi!&rdquo; she called out. &ldquo;Already here today!
The &lsquo;Chosen One&rsquo; said that you were coming tomorrow.
Hurry and follow me. The &lsquo;Favored One&rsquo; said that you
may see it, but his father is still forbidden to view it. We must
quickly send him away. He may not come in!&rdquo; She jogged along
with her lantern as we followed more slowly. It was not
far&mdash;hardly twenty paces. The main residence lay in the middle
of the garden, and the garden house stood along the outer wall.
Mustafa Bustani had not yet caught up with us. He would not have
been able to restrain himself from entering into the room wherein
we now set foot and saw &ldquo;the art.&rdquo; I remembered its
former decor. I had often been inside of this little house. Its
construction was square, with the doorway facing the garden.
Without windows to offer a view to the outside world, the other
three sides were painted ivory-yellow-white and decorated with
gold-lettered maxims regarding cures. Due to its seclusion,
cleanliness, aesthetic stillness, and modesty, this garden house
had always impressed me as soothing. Not so on this
night.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, the door
was jerked wide open. In front of it stood Mustafa Bustani. He had
not yet entered, because his son resisted his doing so. From the
ceiling hung a light fixture whose lamp burned with a bright flame.
In the center of the room, we saw the artist. Before noon, his form
and his shirt had been in two colors&mdash;now they appeared to be
immersed in four: namely in sky-blue, poisonous green, sparkling
yellow, and in scorching red. Such intensive, screaming-colors are
upsetting to one who is highly sensitive about art. Amid all of
this, it is no wonder the boy was not in a good mood. As we came
still closer to the garden house, we heard Thar&rsquo;s angry voice
as he shouted to his father: &ldquo;No! You promised me!&rdquo;
Mustafa Bustani answered: &ldquo;But as you see, Effendi is
here.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
As the father pulled me to his side and showed me to his son, I
announced myself: &ldquo;Here.&rdquo; Thar wondered aloud:
&ldquo;Today already? You were supposed to come tomorrow.
Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re here now.
It&rsquo;s true that I have not yet finished, for you see that the
sharks are still missing; but in due time, I&rsquo;ll put them
in&mdash;this will go very quickly. Both of you, please step in
and&mdash;&ldquo; His father interrupted: &ldquo;And I
too?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish to be
kind and also allow you to enter, because both of the chief guests
are present. I&rsquo;m doing this only because you are occasionally
lenient with me.&rdquo; Mustafa agreed: &ldquo;Unfortunately so!
Allah knows that I am.&rdquo; &nbsp;So not exactly in a mood of
harmony and not quite used to this feeling, we got ready to enjoy
the work of art. I have to note the plain truth about these
circumstances&mdash;neither before nor afterwards did my eyes grasp
the painting&rsquo;s depth of understanding and the height of its
elaboration. Its impact made us feel that we were standing in front
of such an enormous, astonishing, unparalleled achievement. The
absolute least I can do is to give a brief sketch of the situation.
Like a painting by Rafael Santi or a masterpiece by Rembrandt van
Rijn, it&rsquo;s absolutely impossible to describe
fully.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to
oriental custom, the garden house entrance was only open by way of
the garden and thereby closed to the outside world. When we stepped
through the open door, there were three walls that closed off the
room&mdash;to the left, to the right, and straight ahead. As
mentioned earlier, the walls were once painted ivory-yellow with
gold-lettered claims concerning advice on healthy living. Now,
these no longer existed. The middle wall was masculine-blood-red,
or perhaps more of a scorching reddish hue. Both of the side walls
were painted in a shade of ultimate-manly, juicy green color. Above
these hues of red and green, everything was painted blue. High
above on the ceiling, where the light fixture cord was attached,
there sat a large yellow spot. At first, the blotch was probably
round, but this form no longer held its shape as it ran together
with the blue. On the right-hand wall, in the middle of the green,
there stood a white house; it had two doors, a window, and three
chimneys. In the middle of the green left-hand wall, a black house
stood; it had three doors, no windows at all, and two chimneys. To
the left of the mid-field of vision, where the red&nbsp; butted
together with the green, one focused below on a black human heel
that stretched upwards to half of the leg&rsquo;s calf. Midway and
at the bottom portion of the right-hand wall, where the green
jostled against the red, our eyes saw a white human instep that was
connected to half of a shin bone, which appeared to extend out of
the red.&nbsp; Thar had already announced that sharks were supposed
to be added. Even if he put forth all of his effort on the three
walls, I found only a narrow place where a shark would feel at
home.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a kind of
superior look, his eyes glided over us: &ldquo;All of you simply
stand and marvel! Don&rsquo;t you know what it means?&nbsp;
Effendi, do you know what it is?&rdquo;&nbsp; Since he so directly
referred to me, it was best for me to blur my judgment of the
painting&rsquo;s merit. I was very diplomatic, mentioning nothing
objectionable as to what the picture was supposed to be. In any
case, I wanted to keep the artist&rsquo;s high esteem. For this
reason, I simply answered in general terms, yet with a practicable
enthusiasm for this artwork: &ldquo;It is the pure
Blue-green-red-yellow Wonder!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He agreed with me:
&ldquo;Right! You never say something false. It has cost us a lot
of effort and color. Just look this way!&rdquo; He pointed down
towards the floor, where half to entirely empty paint cans stood.
All sorts of paint brushes lay scattered around, and it was
impossible to count the number of clean-up rags and sponges.
&ldquo;We fetched these from the white-washer,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;Since the time was too short and I would not be able to
finish the work alone, the cook had to help me. She just painted
the land, which is easy. As for the rest, I had to do this by
myself; she has no talent to do more.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His father was
extremely upset.&nbsp; With a great deal of effort, he suppressed
his anger and asked: &ldquo;Well then, who gave you permission to
paint over these walls and the expensive inscriptions?&rdquo; His
son answered, &rdquo;Of course, it was you!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&mdash;?&rdquo; stammered the father. Thar replied:
&ldquo;Yes, you yourself. I asked you if I could paint two pictures
in the garden house, and you gave me permission to do
so.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Somehow, was I supposed to
understand that you would paint them on the walls instead of on
paper?&nbsp; Son, we&rsquo;ll talk further about this!&rdquo;&nbsp;
As if he had a stick in his hand, he gestured and added:&nbsp;
&ldquo;By the way, I see only one picture&mdash;not two.&rdquo; The
boy spoke up: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind; there will be more
than two. Here is the first. Still others will follow. Effendi
wants to see what I can do, so I must show him as much as
possible.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Still more
pictures?&nbsp; Like these?&nbsp; Are you crazy?&nbsp; Well then,
which ones?&rdquo; Thar answered: &ldquo;Tomorrow, we are painting
in the harem&mdash;the trumpets of Jericho and how the city&rsquo;s
walls collapsed.&rdquo; Mustafa sighed: &ldquo;Allah have pity on
us. And the day after tomorrow?&rdquo;&nbsp; The boy didn&rsquo;t
hesitate: &ldquo;The day after tomorrow, we are painting the
bedrooms.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In disbelief,
Mustafa asked: &ldquo;But what?&rdquo; &nbsp;Thar was quick to
answer: &ldquo;The downfall of Sodom and Gomorrah, complete with
smoke and fire, lightening and thunder. I&rsquo;ve already ordered
the colors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mustafa was dumbfounded: &ldquo;Already
ordered? &nbsp;This too?&nbsp; Lightening and thunder, smoke and
fire in the bedroom? As for your art, it seems that nothing is
impossible.&nbsp; I realize that I must set limits. &nbsp;What then
is portrayed here? There is no train of thought in
that!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his use of the
word &ldquo;limits,&rdquo; the father had again set something in
motion&mdash;just like this morning when he wanted to take Thar
across his knee.&nbsp; In spite of this threat, the boy had to
laugh as he answered:&nbsp; &ldquo;No thoughts?&nbsp; In there, we
find&nbsp; all of the People of Israel, King Pharaoh, and all of
his Egyptian soldiers!&rdquo; Incredulous, the father inquired
further: &ldquo;How so? On the contrary, I see nothing of
them!&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
because they&rsquo;re in the water!&nbsp; This picture shows the
Children of Israel&rsquo;s passage through the Red Sea. Don&rsquo;t
you see the Red Sea that is right in front of you?&nbsp; And over
there is the blue air; directly above your head is the yellow sun,
because the time of day is exactly noon. Here to the left, the
green land, that is Egypt; and the house, that is the Palace of the
Pharaoh. And here to the right, this green land is Palestine; the
King of the Jebusites lives in the house that stands there. In
between there lies the Red Sea. The Children of Israel were slaves
in Egypt. Moses helped them break away. He fled with them into the
Red Sea. Even now, all of them are stuck in there. With all of his
armies, Pharaoh hurried after them. Look here! The last one of them
has just now disappeared. You can still see his heel which is still
above the water. On the other side over there, the Children of
Israel are just now coming out of the water again. Already you can
see the first one&rsquo;s toes which are half-way out of the water.
As soon as all of them are high and dry, I&rsquo;ll paint in my
sharks; then you&rsquo;ll see that Pharaoh and all of his soldiers
will be devoured&mdash;not a single one of them will remain.
&nbsp;More or less, aren&rsquo;t those the approximate
ideas?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;He stretched
himself out in front of his father and watched his dad&rsquo;s face
as he thought about these explanations. Behind us rang out the
reproachful voice of their African cook. She was standing next to
the door with her wind-lantern. She had heard everything: &ldquo;It
was my hand that produced the entire green land of Egypt and all of
Palestine&rsquo;s greenery. Tomorrow, I&rsquo;m painting
Jericho!&rdquo;&nbsp; At that moment, the good Mustafa Bustani
could no longer control himself. All of his temper burst forth. His
voice thundered at them: &ldquo;Tomorrow, you will learn what you
can paint. March! Come away with me into the
house!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His angry voice
shocked the African cook. She let loose of the lantern which
shattered and extinguished&mdash;running away as fast as her feet
would carry her. Realizing the impact of his wrath, the merchant
immediately tried to take back its harsh impact. He addressed us in
an apologetic tone:&nbsp; &ldquo;Forgive me. Such anger is never
the right thing.&nbsp; Please allow me to accompany
you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We understood and
gladly embraced him. He led us towards the gate through which we
had come. It still stood open. There, he said this to us:
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll keep our plans to travel early tomorrow morning.
I&rsquo;ll pick you up at seven, European time. I don&rsquo;t yet
know whether I&rsquo;ll bring my son along.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife then asked
about his son whom she had grown so fond of: &ldquo;Will you punish
him very severely?&rdquo; Mustafa answered with an unusually solemn
tone: &ldquo;In this situation, I&rsquo;ll have to think about who
deserves the punishment here. With both of you here, it&rsquo;s as
if a light has come to me.&nbsp; Since this morning, it seems as if
I now have entirely new eyes and ears. How did it happen that you,
without any kind of perceptible reason, came along the same path
leading to the heights of the Mount of Olives&mdash;the one which I
daily climb&mdash;precisely at the same time?&rdquo; I gently
tossed out this word: &ldquo;Coincidence!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You say that without personally believing it. I know all too
well that you consider the word &ldquo;coincidence&rdquo; to be an
embarrassing fabrication. However, for now that&rsquo;s
unimportant. Above all else this evening, I have to think about my
son. I would like to be alone this evening. And without feeling
ashamed, I can say to both of you that I must pray. This thought
has come to me:&nbsp; I have placed the soul of my child upon the
wrong path.&nbsp; Allah alone knows the hidden depths of our
hearts. He wants to show me what is correct and what is false.
Please, do not concern yourselves about the boy. He won&rsquo;t
receive punishment which he doesn&rsquo;t deserve.&nbsp; Good
night.&rdquo; Extending our hands to him, we also said &ldquo;Good
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; We were eager to see how tomorrow&rsquo;s
affairs would develop.</span></p>

<b>II. Towards Hebron!</b></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh what memories are
connected to the name of this old and famous city of kings and
descendants of Levi! Located just twenty miles south of Jerusalem,
Hebron may be the oldest city in the Promised Land. It existed
three thousand years before the birth of Christ. According to the
traditional teachings of the Middle Ages, it is in this vicinity
where God created Adam.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventeen miles southwest of
Jerusalem, there&rsquo;s the city of Kirjath-arba, where mythical
giants once lived. Later, Hebron was the capitol city of the
Hittites, whose princes resided there. After the Children of
Israel&rsquo;s conquest of Canaan, the city fell to the Family of
Caleb. Later, King David spent the first seven years of his reign
here. At the city gates, David&rsquo;s General Joab murdered Abner,
the Commander-in-Chief of King Saul&rsquo;s army. Upon
David&rsquo;s orders, it was here that the men who assassinated
Saul&rsquo;s son Ishbosheth were hung. From Hebron, Absalom
launched the rebellion against his father, King David. During the
Israelites&rsquo; captivity in Babylon, the city fell into the
hands of the Edomites, Esau&rsquo;s people&mdash;which Judas
Maccabaeus drove out. The Romans destroyed the city and sold its
inhabitants into slavery. The Crusaders made Hebron their
Bishop-City. It has also become ever more holy to Muslims, because
it was the dwelling place of the Patriarchs. In the past, Abraham
lived there, and Jacob&rsquo;s caravan to Egypt began at Hebron.
The Muslims call Abraham the friend of merciful compassion; from
this title, Hebron received its current Arabic name, <u>El
Chalil</u>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, Hebron is highly
revered&mdash;but unfortunately, the city is not friendly toward
strangers, particularly Christians. In the entire land,
Hebron&rsquo;s population is the most bigoted. There are
approximately nine thousand Muslims and five hundred Jews, who in
fact want to earn as much money as possible from a
Christian&mdash;yet they consider him to be inferior and even an
unclean enemy whose mere touch can make them dirty. Through&nbsp;
Hebron&rsquo;s lanes, a Christian pedestrian gets along OK if he
tries very hard to avoid looking into the eyes of &ldquo;the true
believers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Otherwise, trouble can easily happen. At
the least, &nbsp;youth who follow him will not just shout out curse
words&mdash;they will also throw solid objects. The most pronounced
expression of this hostile relationship is evident in the fact that
Hebron&rsquo;s inns are not open to Christians&mdash;even though
the city&rsquo;s well-traveled roadway connects to Jerusalem.
Today, it may be different; it was in the year 1900 when I last
visited Hebron.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In light of Christians&rsquo; common veneration of the patriarch
Abraham, Europeans visit this city of historical names&mdash;in
spite of its unfriendly population.&nbsp; When his wife Sarah died,
Abraham purchased the double burial cave called Machpela; the
Hittite Ephron sold him this grave site. Thus in a burial chamber,
she was transformed. Some say that the following famous six are
entombed here: Abraham. Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah.
Among the Greek-speaking Jews, some say that the Byzantine Emperor
Justinian lies here.&nbsp; Above this spot, a church was once
established&mdash;which the Muslims converted into a mosque;
unfortunately, Christians are not allowed to visit this site.
Christians are only permitted to come near the outer perimeter of
this shrine. In order to go beyond that limit, one must be a
high-level, princely person&mdash;especially one that holds a
<u>firman</u>, a royal decree from the Ottoman Empire. &nbsp;In
this same region, upon <u>Der el Arba&rsquo;in</u>, one finds the
grave of Jesse, King David&rsquo;s father. A half hour from the
city stands Abraham&rsquo;s Well, where some claim that this is the
scene where once the Oaks of Mamre stood. [ Mamre was the Amorite
chief who gave his name to the plain where Abraham dwelt, Genesis
23: 19.] Almost every place in the surrounding area is intertwined
with some memory of the patriarchs. So for this reason, it was also
a desire of mine to visit Hebron as often as I was in Jerusalem. So
it is now. (Photo, 148 KB-Jpg. The Apostles&rsquo; fountain: on the
road between Jerusalem and Bethany, which tradition says is the
place where Jesus rested with his disciples.)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>At exactly 7 o&rsquo;clock the next morning,
a comfortable, fully covered four-passenger carriage arrived at our
door. Therein, sat Mustafa Bustani and Thar.&nbsp; When my wife saw
them, she said: &ldquo;So, he&rsquo;s allowed to come after
all.&rdquo; I too was pleased about this. The boy sprang out of the
carriage. He was festively dressed: golden shoes, white stockings,
white pants, and a white Bedouin-shirt with a red vest that had
Hungarian Hussar gold-braided cords. Upon his head sat a red fez,
to which &nbsp;a white, silken neck-scarf was fastened. Today, the
boy looked exceptionally distinguished. &ldquo;We are here. Father
bids you to come,&rdquo; said Thar. His voice had an official and
powerful ring to it. In a softer and more confidential tone, he
officially put forth this question: &ldquo;Yesterday evening, did
you also think that I would receive a good thrashing? No?
I&rsquo;ve thought a great deal about it. I wish that he had
whipped me.&rdquo; For a moment, he pondered over this&mdash;then
he repeated these words: &ldquo;Yes, yes, I wanted it that
way!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&ldquo;If the beating were over, my
father would no longer be angry and sad.&nbsp; It would no longer
be painful for me either. As long as I have to await punishment,
even as I do right now, he still has the sad eyes&mdash;and that
causes me twice the pain.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wanted to know the reason:
&ldquo;In what way is it doubled?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo; First, I&rsquo;ll tell you about his
eyes, then secondly about the thrashing which is yet to come.&nbsp;
Due to the fact that the punishment usually never happens, I
ceaselessly and hopelessly feel this way in advance. So today, it
will perhaps be the same. Since yesterday evening, his sad eyes
have hurt me. Mostly, he doesn&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;not a
single thing. Early today, he personally woke me up and helped me
get dressed. When he stood so silently in my room, I could no
longer bear it; I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him,
begging him to punish me&mdash;soundly and vigorously. He just
gently smiled and shook his head. Do you think he is doing the
right thing?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>I gave him this advice: &ldquo;At all times,
what your father does is the right thing. You must come to
understand this.&rdquo; Thar questioned me: &ldquo;Even when I
regard his actions as wrong?&rdquo;&nbsp; Here was my reply:
&ldquo;Then too!&nbsp; When you grow older, just as he is now, you
will have an experience that will convince you that he was right.
Oh well, come on! Your father is always so punctual&mdash;we
shouldn&rsquo;t keep him waiting.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Now just a moment,&rdquo; he pleaded.
&ldquo;I still have something to tell you; today is Friday, a
holiday. It&rsquo;s forbidden for me to get dirty. For that reason,
I didn&rsquo;t bring along any colors. Nevertheless, I am a hero.
You see, it isn&rsquo;t required that a hero be painted up when he
wants to conquer his enemies. There are also cases in
which&mdash;&ldquo; At that point, my wife jokingly added this
line: &ldquo;&mdash;the victor actually has no paint at all.
Yesterday, you told us that you wanted to paint the first storming
of Palestine&rsquo;s City of Jericho.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you think
about that project on this special Friday?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;The boy answered her: &ldquo;Anyway,
nothing could be done about Jericho. I lack the means to capture
the necessary noise.&nbsp; I can paint the trumpets and also the
walls; but how am I supposed to insert the loud racket when I
can&rsquo;t portray that part of the picture? It&rsquo;s really too
bad&mdash;just a crying shame. So, now I&rsquo;m ready. Let&rsquo;s
go.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>We broke off our conversation and went to the
carriage. Just as we were climbing in, &nbsp;Lord Pasha Osman Achyr
&nbsp;interrupted his morning excursion and came riding upon his
fat donkey.&nbsp; For a moment, he reigned back on his steed, gave
us a friendly greeting, then directed this question to the
boy:&nbsp; &ldquo;Well then, which hero are you today?&rdquo; With
his usual presence of mind, Thar answered: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Joshua
the Conqueror. I&rsquo;m going into the Land of the Canaanites in
order to show them that we are not afraid of them.&rdquo; The Pasha
played along: &ldquo;Where does this land lie?&rdquo; &nbsp;The boy
replied: &ldquo;In Gilgal.&rdquo; The Pascha cautioned him:
&ldquo;My boy, be careful then. Without asking first about your
reason for being there, the people will cut you down.&rdquo; With
that parting advice, he rode off. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Regarding what was necessary for our journey,
Mustafa Bustani assured us that he had taken care of everything.
Thar leapt onto the seat beside the coachman where he felt more
free and higher than in the deeper part of the carriage beside us.
The horses then began to pull forward. Our steep path went from the
Jaffa Gate into the Hinnom Valley, which carries the Jewish and
Islamic references&nbsp; to &ldquo;hell.&rdquo; We traveled farther
to the Sultan&rsquo;s Pool; and from there, again upward to the
high and level Bethel. Thereon lies the Cloister of Rabbi Elijah,
from which we could admire a broad and outstanding view. This
monastery is associated with the Prophet Elijah, and nearby is a
spring where the Holy Family reportedly drew
water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;Beyond this monastery, you&rsquo;ll
find Rachel&rsquo;s Crypt, the burial site of&nbsp; Patriarch
Jacob&rsquo;s wife. At this holy site, we read these words:
&nbsp;&ldquo; On the road to Ephratah, which is now called
Bethlehem, Rachel died and was buried. &nbsp;So Jacob erected a
memorial upon her grave;&nbsp; to this day, Rachel&rsquo;s monument
is still there.&rdquo;&nbsp; The road divides at this
place.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>To the left,
it goes towards Bethlehem; straight ahead lies Hebron. We took the
latter direction.&nbsp; After forty-five minutes, we came to the
Three Pools of Solomon. Long before the Christian era, these aqua
ducts were constructed in order to supply water to Jerusalem. Even
though these pools and the region&rsquo;s small castle hold
historical and architectural significance,&nbsp; they have no
bearing on our story&mdash;so for now, we&rsquo;ll bypass
them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of more interest to
me is the broad Wadi a-&lsquo;Arish;&nbsp; midway between Jerusalem
and Hebron, &nbsp;a &ldquo;caf&eacute;&rdquo; was erected, a place
where men and animals can find a place to rest themselves.
Don&rsquo;t picture a European-style caf&eacute;.&nbsp; Instead,
imagine a narrow, low-quality, jagged stone building wherein a
rather squalid fellow boils dirty water in a filthy pot as he makes
a brew which he calls &ldquo;coffee&rdquo;&mdash;a drink that he
sells to European passersby, all at sinfully expensive
prices.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Yet the sin does not stem from the price that
he demands. Oh no, he&rsquo;s too sly for that. This might result
in a complaint that could lead to cancellation of his license to
sell coffee. He works this more cleverly. For the locals, he sets
the lowest possible price; but for foreigners, he always says this:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take what you give me!&rdquo; In this way, he
neither dissuades nor pleads.&nbsp; Since European travelers are
almost always well-to-do, having extra money to afford elevated
sentiments, the coffee-innkeeper gives them the impression that
he&rsquo;s needy&mdash;all with the aim that they will pay him a
price which is more like a present, or even an excessive
tariff.&nbsp; For a very small oriental cup, which contained no
more than two or three thimbles-worth of coffee, he held out his
hand long enough to receive more than a German Mark&mdash;whereas
five Pfennig would have been entirely enough.&nbsp; I had always
been generous towards him.&nbsp; However, the last time I stopped
at his place, I saw how he was laughing at me as I rode
away&mdash;so today, he shall pay dearly for that.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>When we arrived at his
&ldquo;caf&eacute;,&rdquo; we stopped and climbed out of the
carriage. He rushed outside; and with an exaggerated deep bow, he
asked about our &ldquo;orders.&rdquo; Mustafa Bustani first ordered
five cups of coffee, then five more; for a third time, he ordered
still another five. Altogether, that came to fifteen cups. The man
melted into a downcast spirit; he knew that Mustafa Bustani was no
foreigner and that he often stopped here on his business trips to
Hebron. So, he could not treat him like a European. When we were
preparing to leave and climbing into our carriage, I took out my
money pouch. The shop owner&rsquo;s face completely lit up. I asked
how much it cost for the fifteen cups of coffee. &ldquo;Give what
you wish,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only pay the price that
you demand,&rdquo; I declared.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>This accomplished nothing. He absolutely
refused to set a price. So when I threatened to pay him nothing if
he wouldn&rsquo;t give me a price, he simply answered with this:
&ldquo;OK, I&rsquo;ll give them to you as a present.&rdquo; This
trick had always worked for him. He assumed that no European would
allow him to give away his coffee. So, I acted just as he
expected.&nbsp; Appearing to be overwhelmed with his generosity, I
gave him a franc. In Palestine, the franc is the most prized silver
coin. He looked at it, then handed it back to me and said:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving the money back to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; After
taking the coin back, I first gave him two, then three
francs.&nbsp; Once again, he declined the money and repeated these
words: &ldquo;I give these as presents to you.&rdquo; I understood
how this man operated; I knew just how far I could take this. His
greed for money grew with every increase of my offer. I gave him
four, then finally five francs. With this last sum, he closed his
hand and made a movement as if he wanted to pocket the money. At
the same time, he inquisitively looked at me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>I put on my most good-natured face and raised
my hand as if to reach into my money bag once again.&nbsp; This was
too much for him; he could not resist. In a tone of voice which
made it seem that any payment for the coffee was simply impossible,
he handed me the five francs: &ldquo;I also give these to
you!&rdquo; Ever so slowly and in a way that would not diminish the
pleasure of this scene,&nbsp; I took back the money, &nbsp;put the
coins in my bag, and answered him: &ldquo;So, I give in to your
kindness, and I accept your present. I thank you. Live long and
well!&nbsp; May Allah bless you and your house for your noble
generosity towards all foreign guests!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Since we didn&rsquo;t want to hurry and
thereby lessen the great effect of our departure, we slowly stood
up and watched the expression on his face. Acting as if he wanted
to keep us there, he held up his outstretched arms. His mouth gaped
open. &nbsp;Upon his face lay an expression of confused dismay, one
which bordered on outright shock. He was speechless, uttering
neither word nor sound.&nbsp; To make up for lost time, the horses
fell into a trot.&nbsp; When we came to the next curve in the road
where we looked back, the man still stiffly stood there in the same
spot.&nbsp; What followed was whole-hearted laughter&mdash;even the
Arabic coachman joined in the fun.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>The rest of the trip provided a lot of
historical points of interest, which at the time seemed to have no
connection to the former events. In Ain ed Dirwe, there is a
beautiful hewn-stone fountain where the 8<sup>th</sup> chapter of
<u>Acts</u> describes how the Christian Apostle Phillip converted
and baptized the Ethiopian Queen Candace&rsquo; royal
treasurer.&nbsp; Farther on, we came across the ruins of Beth Zur,
the &ldquo;house of rock,&rdquo; just southwest of Jerusalem.
Chapter 15, verse 58 in the Old Testament <u>Book of Joshua</u>
notes the importance of Beth Zur in the time of the Hebrew hero
Judas Maccabeus.&nbsp; Chapter 3, verse 16 of <u>The Book</u> <u>of
Nehemiah</u> also cites its history.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>A half hour later and perhaps 400 steps on
the left-hand side of the roadway, we came to the large stone
structure of Abraham&rsquo;s Cistern, more commonly called
&ldquo;Abraham&rsquo;s Well.&rdquo; At this place, we still had a
lot to keep us thoroughly busy. Regarding this famous site, I offer
one of my wife&rsquo;s photographs.&nbsp; There in the corner, I am
sitting on the edge of the Cistern, clothed like an
Arab&mdash;except for my bare head. Forward and to the right, is
the Arabic Donkey Driver, whom I will introduce later
on.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Before reaching this place near the city,
imagine long ago when there were vineyards and gardens that even in
olden times had a reputation for their good fruits. For example,
it&rsquo;s said that this is where Moses&rsquo; military scouts
visited Hebron&rsquo;s Brook of Eschcol and cut the gigantic
cluster of grapes which they carried back to the camp of the
Israelites as a proof of the fruitfulness of the land
(<u>Numbers</u> 13: 23).&nbsp; From here to the city, it takes only
a half hour.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>In earlier days, whenever I traveled to
Hebron, I called on my venerable and extraordinarily agreeable old
acquaintance, Jew Eppstein. Since he comes from Germany, he speaks
German exceptionally well. Regarding the local hatred of Christians
which every German assumes to be the case, he very weakly
subscribed to that prejudice. Since I was following Mustafa
Bustani&rsquo;s travel plans, today I was unable to visit Eppstein.
By stopping at a Jew&rsquo;s place, Mustafa would have forever
damaged his reputation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>So we drove on, arriving at the address of
one of his business friends, a place that had enough room to
accommodate the horses and carriage. Was it also possible for him
to accept my wife and me? &nbsp;Fortunately, he was a man who was
among the few broad-minded, tolerant believers who live in Hebron.
After some hesitation, we were taken in&mdash; but separate from
Mustafa and his son. For us, there was a small, four-cornered room
that had no windows. In order to have light, we had to leave the
door open, which also let in the stinky, filthy air from the
farmyard. If we were bold and daring enough, we could sit upon the
room&rsquo;s single piece of furniture, a straw mat. After spending
a half hour in there, someone brought us an old pitcher of stagnant
water that was not drinkable.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>When we sought answers to our questions, we
could learn nothing more than this: due to the fact that we were
Christians and not Muslims, this was the only kind of water that he
was permitted to offer us.&nbsp; Besides, no one else would be
permitted to drink from our pitcher, because it would now be
considered &ldquo;unclean.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, this was the
hospitality of a so-called &ldquo;tolerant&rdquo; Muslim.&nbsp; How
would we have fared with one who was intolerant? I asked Mustafa
Bustani to come to our room.&nbsp; He came and brought along
Thar.&nbsp; He apologized. The man told him that we had been well
taken care of&mdash;befitting our social standing.&nbsp; We
informed Mustafa that we now preferred to go to Jew
Eppstein&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Right away, Thar was determined to accompany
us. His father didn&rsquo;t object.&nbsp; As much as Mustafa wished
, he couldn&rsquo;t do otherwise. Now that he was already there, he
pointed out the necessity of the meeting and the visit; this
situation placed a demand upon him, but these matters didn&rsquo;t
obligate his son. Thus, he was thankful that we wanted to take Thar
with us.&nbsp; First of all, Mustafa suggested that he go to the
Arab who had wanted to sell the saddle. It was on account of this
saddle that he had made the journey, so it was readily understood
that this matter had been settled earlier. At this time, my wife
spoke up: &ldquo;Since it is Friday, are you allowed to buy and
sell?&rdquo; Mustafa answered: &ldquo;In this case, yes.&nbsp; We
don&rsquo;t live here, so we are considered passers-by and
customers who can&rsquo;t wait.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>My wife reasoned further:&nbsp; &ldquo;After
all, we too are part of the hospitality reserved for passers-by,
courtesies for those who can not wait.&nbsp; Why are Muslims
pliable when it comes to making money, yet harshly inconsiderate
whenever it comes to showing love and kind-heartedness to those
same foreigners?&rdquo; Mustafa Bustani pleaded his case:
&ldquo;According to Islam, hospitality belongs to those who are
virtuous, and no one is released from this obligation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She pressed him further: &ldquo;Also when it comes to other
religious faiths?&rdquo;&nbsp; Unequivocally, he answered her:
&ldquo;Yes, this is true for Christians, Jews, and
heathens.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>She pressed him for more:&nbsp; &ldquo;If the
residents of Hebron then claim to be Muslims, yet they don&rsquo;t
practice this commandment, how then can they be true confessors
of&nbsp; the Prophet Mohammed?&rdquo; Our friend conceded:
&ldquo;Arguably, no one can answer this.&rdquo; Here, I joined in:
&ldquo;On the contrary. Our Thar has already answered. Earlier
today, he spoke with the Ferik-Pasha.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>The boy had been listening to us.&nbsp; When
he now learned that he had answered a question that his father
believed to be unanswerable, he felt very important: &ldquo;Yes,
that&rsquo;s correct.&nbsp; I always know more than other
people!&nbsp; Thus, our cook and her husband always call me
&lsquo;The Chosen One.&rsquo; Effendi, please tell me what I
said.&rdquo;&nbsp; I recalled his description: &ldquo;Figuratively
speaking&mdash;but not without reasonable cause&mdash;you labeled
Hebron&rsquo;s inhabitants as Canaanites.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Oh yes. I always have reasons. Only on
the surface are they Muslims&mdash;on the inside, they will always
be Canaanites. In the process of refinement during Moses&rsquo;
time and that of Islam, they have been passed by, and now they are
at the bottom of the barrel. Effendi, now I remember that I was the
first to figure this out.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t forgotten the
history of Moses&rsquo; time, nor the origins of Islam.&nbsp; So,
just how do we actually identify all the Palestinian people in
Canaan? They go by these names: Hittites, Jebusites, Girgashites,
Hivites, people of Arka, Amorites, Sidonians, Phenicians, those in
Zemar, Arvadians, Hamathians, and all others dwelling in Zidon. You
will probably not retain this information.&rdquo;&nbsp; I agreed:
&ldquo;Here is my notebook. Please write them for
me.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>From the inner pocket of his vest, he took
out a small notebook and gave it to me. I was happy to see what it
contained. What he had recorded was quite accurate and concerned
fairly serious things. I noted the eleven names, then gave the
small journal back to him. Right away, he began to read through the
list, as if he were memorizing the words. In the meantime, his
father went to the innkeeper, expressing our thanks for the
hospitality. When he returned, we went in search of the owner of
the saddle.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>The trader picked it up and showed it to us.
Without announcing the cost, he explained that he would sell it for
a price that I would judge to be fair&mdash; not excessive. The
object was really magnificent, and according to him, a bargain.
Mustafa made the initial mistake of saying that I was the buyer,
not he.&nbsp; Immediately, the Arab explained that he wanted
nothing to do with me, a so-called infidel. It would be a sin to
sell a Christian this saddle which a Muslim Pasha had
owned&mdash;so, we must leave without achieving our
purpose.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Mustafa Bustani was extremely outraged at
this kind of treatment. Nevertheless, we were calmly determined to
put this incident behind us. Mustafa wanted to accompany us to the
Burial Site of Abraham, yet here too we had no luck.&nbsp; In every
narrow and dirty alleyway through which we traveled, people looked
at us with hostile eyes. Since we wanted to avoid running into
danger and being mistreated at the hands of these people, we simply
had to turn around at certain places and stations. On such an
important occasion as today and as a Muslim, Mustafa Bustani should
have felt ashamed to be leading two Christians to this holy
site.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Never before had I personally experienced
such intolerance. Actually, it was always the opposite case; I had
been guided to the inner sanctuary, although I never went
inside.&nbsp; Mustafa asked someone about the importance of today,
so now we learned that this was both a birthday celebration and a
commemoration of the expulsion of Ishmael, the eldest son of
Abraham. Sarah had insisted that her husband banish his
servant-maid Hagar and their son Ishmael to the desert. Now, we
better understood the source of our inhospitable treatment from the
bigoted saddle-merchant and from the mosque&rsquo;s fanatical
officials.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>The commemoration of their national
ancestor&rsquo;s exile had absolutely doubled their existing
abrasiveness.&nbsp; Jews were put on notice that they were not
allowed to be seen&mdash;and the same was true for me.&nbsp; Given
the fact that my wife was with me, this could &nbsp;easily have
been taken as an act of defiance which would have heightened
hostilities rather than minimize them.&nbsp; Thus, I had to give
Mustafa Bustani my word that I would now go straight to
Eppstein&rsquo;s home and eat at his house. I was to avoid the city
streets, following only the outlying paths to Jew Eppstein&rsquo;s
house. There were still two sites that we wanted to visit:
Abraham&rsquo;s Oak of Mamre and the Sacred Heights of Hebron.
&nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, the latter route is approximately
400 hundred paces from the road to Jerusalem.&nbsp; So we set the
exact time when we would stop the carriage and leave Mustafa and
Hebron behind us, thereby starting our journey to Eppstein&rsquo;s
place.&nbsp; At the agreed upon time, we parted company. Thar was
exceptionally happy that he was allowed to go with us. Without
further words from his father, I didn&rsquo;t overlook the evident
trust that his father had placed in me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>With all of his most generous hospitality, my
brave and old friend Eppstein received us into his home. What is
most commonly known as the home&rsquo;s &ldquo;best room&rdquo; was
ours. It was a relatively airy room that was located on the flat
roof top.&nbsp; In my wife&rsquo;s journal, wherein she happily
noted such details, she wrote the following lines: &ldquo;It was a
very hot day. We were given a beautiful, cool, domed room that had
two broadly curved arches. Three of the walls had windows, and the
door was on the fourth. Conditions there were simply splendid. The
room&rsquo;s furnishings consisted of two beds. To the side of one
was a reconditioned couch with three antique pillows; next to it
was a table with four wooden chairs.&nbsp; The other had a
white-ruffled canopy bed.&nbsp; In the corner was a water pitcher
that probably dated to the time of Christ. The walls were tinted
with a bluish white-wash. A brass wash-service sat upon one of the
chairs. I won&rsquo;t say a word about the pictures on the walls.
We were served excellent Hebron wine, a bottle of which cost one
franc. We dined on food that had required a great deal of
preparation, all of which certainly was worth the effort.&rdquo;
Considering the generous hospitality that we had received, we
didn&rsquo;t need to send for the food that Mustafa Bustani had
brought along.&nbsp; Those items were packed away in our carriage
and would come in handy when we turned towards home.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>In the course of the meal, Eppstein told us
about today&rsquo;s big Children&rsquo;s Fitness-Festival, a
birthday celebration in honor of the boy Ishmael. The children were
drawn to the city&rsquo;s open spaces, where they were invited to
take part in all kinds of peaceable and war-like games; adults were
lining up to help supervise them. Since so many stories are told
about the expulsion and the injustices that were sustained, no
person from another faith should even want to be a bystander.&nbsp;
When Eppstein heard that we had the intention of riding to the Oak
and on to Abraham&rsquo;s Well, he immediately advised us to cancel
those plans. There could be trouble if a procession of children
were to pass by these holy sites. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Filled with indignation, Thar yelled out:
&ldquo;Keep our distance? Flee? That is never the case with us. As
for Effendi and me, we fear nothing.&nbsp; Regarding the Mrs., she
too is not afraid, because I have told her that I&rsquo;m a hero,
and she can always call upon me in a time of need. Chuckling to
himself, Eppstein considered how this child could have such
self-esteem: &ldquo;A hero?&rdquo; &nbsp;With that remark, he came
down on the wrong side of the boy. Thar rose from the table, came
towards him, and answered that question: &ldquo;You laugh at
me?&nbsp; I will not tolerate that. My name is Thar, and woe to you
if I should ever take revenge against you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Jew Eppstein kept on joking: &ldquo;Well,
would that be really bad for me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Thar was irritated:
&ldquo;So, you continue to laugh at me?&nbsp; Mind what you say! In
truth, I&rsquo;m just eleven years old, but in all of Jerusalem
there isn&rsquo;t a single fourteen year old that I haven&rsquo;t
wrestled to the ground!&rdquo; Still smiling, Eppstein pressed
further: &ldquo;Do you also consider me to be such a fourteen year
old?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;No. Well then, how old are
you?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say
sixty.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;For all I care, it&rsquo;s the same to
me if you&rsquo;re a hundred.&nbsp; Now pay
attention!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Thar quickly slipped behind him, forcing his
arms behind him.&nbsp; With a jerk and a squeeze, Eppstein ended up
sitting on the ground&mdash;where previously he had stood.
Naturally, this was the result of the boy&rsquo;s quickness and the
way he managed to take the man by surprise.&nbsp; Even so, the boy
had physical powers that exceeded the usual strength of an eleven
year old. With a satisfied nod to Jew Eppstein, Thar returned to
his place at the table: &ldquo;At first, you laughed from
above&mdash;now you laugh from below!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Tell me now, where did you develop
such knack and quickness?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp; Thar answered: &ldquo;From the Lions
Club.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;What is that? How and
where?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s in Jerusalem. We boys have
four clubs where we can practice. The Lions Club meets in front
of&nbsp; the western Jaffa Gate.&nbsp; At the northwestern Damascus
Gate, you&rsquo;ll find The Elephant Club. Just outside of
Stephen&rsquo;s Gate, The Hippos play. &nbsp;The Whales claim The
Pool of Siloah as their practice grounds. As you know, these are
strong and noble animals. With their speed and the power of their
leaps, The Lions triumph, just as I&rsquo;ve done here.&nbsp; As
you already know, The Elephans trample together. The Hippos run
with their heads linked together; in this way, the strongest roots
himself to the spot while the others collapse inward. The Whales do
battle only in the ocean. One ducks under the opposition, and with
a mouth full of water he spews it into the air, just like whales
do.&nbsp; Therein lies the victory!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a member of all
four clubs; and to this day, no one has beaten me. Hey, do we want
to work together like Hippos?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Thar lowered his head and prepared to ram Mr.
Eppstein, but he immediately stepped to the side and called out:
&ldquo;Leave me in peace. I am not one of those beasts!&nbsp; I
only wanted to warn you about today&rsquo;s dangers&mdash;never
considering that I would be treacherously ambushed. Should I
contact a reliable rent-a-donkey business for the trip you&rsquo;re
planning?&rdquo;&nbsp; I answered: &ldquo;Yes. Preferably one that
does not devour Christians.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Mr. Eppstein was glad to help: &ldquo;There
is only one, so I&rsquo;ll ask him to come. It saddens me to
acknowledge that today is such a Day of Hate.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry
to say that your wife was only permitted to see the outside of the
mosque.&nbsp; I have always said this, so I&rsquo;ll continue to
repeat it: If the faith of these people were pure and noble, then
they would not find it necessary to keep others away from their
shrines.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>He excused himself and sent for the
donkey-lender.&nbsp; Thar pulled out his notebook and thoughtfully
recorded this quote from Mr. Eppstein. For him, those words seemed
important enough to remember. In a short time, the donkey-driver
arrived and heard our requests. As our photograph shows, he looked
Moorish, but he seemed to be good-natured and not a person to
inconvenience us. He had no horses whatsoever; &nbsp;not even one
donkey was available. On account of the festival, all animals had
been reserved ahead of time. However, there were three mules that
he could lend us.&nbsp; We could honestly say that they were only
suited for pulling a cart, not for riding. One of them had an
especially stubborn temperament, but we had to be thankful that
these dear animals were still available. So we closed the deal with
this merchant and asked that he bring the mules without
delay.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Whenever a Middle Easterner, and particularly
a donkey-driver promises to turn up without delay, this may mean
that he will arrive one or even two hours from then. Yet this
fellow was true to his word; in just thirty minutes, he showed up.
He claimed that he would have come even sooner if he hadn&rsquo;t
found it necessary to clean the animals before he delivered them to
us. I don&rsquo;t care to describe them, so I&rsquo;ll simply
confess that the sight of them was no minor fright for
us.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>They consisted of skin and bones. For well
over a month, they had neither seen a washing, a scrubbing, nor a
curry-comb. What was supposed to pass for a saddle and strapping
was a sheer hodge-podge of things that didn&rsquo;t fit. The
lady&rsquo;s saddle was such a boldly sad afterthought of
improvisation. In light of the donkey-driver&rsquo;s freethinking
and artistic invention, I paid him an extra baksheesh&mdash;an act
for which he solemnly assured me that I had his everlasting love,
loyalty, and devotion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Needless to say, we wanted to provide feed
for the poor animals. They fed on everything edible, including all
the bread that we found in Eppstein&rsquo;s house&mdash;and still
they were not full. The prettiest parts about them were their
names. Mine was called &ldquo;Guewerdschina,&rdquo; which means
&ldquo;dove.&rdquo;&nbsp; Naturally, I managed to pick the one that
seemed to be the most ornery&mdash;and it proved to be true. In
both a good and bad sense, we would have quite an experience with
this one.&nbsp; After we paid the rental fee, mounted our mules,
and prepared to ride away, it became evident that Guewerdschina
didn&rsquo;t want to go along. She would not budge from her
space.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>I now applied all of my equestrian
skills.&nbsp; The Donkey Driver himself gave it his best effort,
and Eppstein&rsquo;s servants did the same&mdash;but all their
efforts were in vain. They knew the stubborn nature of this dumb
animal, so they were sure that it would rather die than take just
two steps from its spot. What was I supposed to do? Like the Donkey
Driver, should we too just walk along beside her? No!&nbsp; Once
again, I mounted the mule and ordered the Driver to lead
Guewerdschina. Of course, she followed him. Once we had left the
city behind us and we had reached open fields, I had hoped to
convince her to ride on&mdash;and I partially succeeded. Kind words
and caressing didn&rsquo;t help at all, and whipping the animal
accomplished even less. So I tried something with my thumb; from
the side of &ldquo;the dove,&rdquo; I pressed hard between the
first two vertebrae.&nbsp; She shot forward and obeyed me for a
little while, but not for long. I was convinced that I had to
experiment from a new angle. During the entire journey, I agonized
about what I should do with this contrary beast.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>From the time we left the gardens till we
reached the Oak of Abraham, a half hour passed. It&rsquo;s said
that The Oak of Mamre originated during the time of the first
patriarchs. This is an exaggeration. It belongs to the genus
<u>Quercus ilex psudo-coccifera</u>, which has a base circumference
of approximately ten meters. At the height of four meters, this
tree begins to fork and to form immense boughs. For the most part,
the tree is already beginning to die as it branches out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>As early as the sixteenth century, this tree
was venerated; anyway, it has a considerably different
age&mdash;and it probably will not stand much longer than it
already has. It belongs to the Russians who established a hospice
here and built an observation tower; from its height, one can see
all the way to the Dead Sea. For just a small fee, the key to this
tower can be fetched inside the hospice.&nbsp; I sent Thar inside
and asked him to bring me the key. After he did that errand, he
brought me a cord that he had found.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>While he was showing the rope to me, he said:
&ldquo;This is for your dear Guewerdschina. I want you to use this
when you ride her away from here.&rdquo; I had my doubts about
that: &ldquo;Do you think you can make her move from this
spot?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;With no trouble at
all.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=

remedy?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=

time.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=

earlier?</span></p>

'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Sly as a fox, he winked at me and laughed;
his gorgeously white teeth glistened as he answered:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I wanted to double your delight, and the
cure can only be doubly pleasing when it follows prior
turmoil.&nbsp; Watch this!&rdquo; He took the middle of the rope
and firmly tied a knot around the tail of&nbsp; &ldquo;the
dove,&rdquo; so that both ends of the cord hung down&mdash;then he
climbed onto the saddle.&nbsp; We wanted to start out on our trip
to Harem Ramet el Chalil, to the Sacred Heights of Hebron.&nbsp; My
wife sat upon her mule, and I climbed onto the one that Thar had
been riding. Now, we simply had to wait and see what the boy was
going to do. The donkey driver handed him both ends of the rope,
which he calmly held in his hands. &ldquo;Now, watch how quickly
this works,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Make room; I&rsquo;m riding on
ahead.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>We moved to the side. He goaded dear
Guewerdschina. She swished her ears and waggled her tail, but she
took no steps forward. He struck her, but that did no good. He
screamed at her and slapped his feet into her sides&mdash;all to no
avail. So he pulled on both ends of the rope. With that trick, the
mule&rsquo;s tail flipped up and onto her rump. Thar then wrapped
the cords around her belly and tied a knot, thereby firmly
stretching the ropes in a way that they could not release
backwards. Guewerdschina was visibly startled. Nothing like this
had ever happened in her lifetime. Like the wings of a windmill,
she flailed her ears. She also wanted to whisk her tail, but that
couldn&rsquo;t happen. At this point, she let her ears droop down
as she contemplated her troubles. To this spirited annoyance, the
boy added a rambunctious swat. This caused &ldquo;the dove&rdquo;
to turn her head to the right, trying to look behind her&mdash;but
she saw nothing. So she turned to her left and tried to see what
was behind.&nbsp; In spite of her tremendous efforts to move her
tail so that she could see it, she couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Now she&rsquo;s unbearably
worried!&rdquo; laughed Thar. &ldquo;She thinks her tail is gone.
She believes that some frightening thing is behind her.&nbsp; Now
she will run for all she&rsquo;s worth!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>The words
were hardly out of his mouth when Guewerdschina let out a bone
marrow-jarring hee-haw. She cringed and arched her back like a
cat.&nbsp; She lunged to the right and to the left&mdash;then with
sudden haste, she shot straight forward, as if she wanted to charge
beyond her own head. It required a very good rider not to fall
off;&nbsp; Thar effortlessly stayed in the saddle. Laughing
heartily, we followed him as fast as we could. In light of the
tragically comical, apprehensive demeanor of mules, it really was
impossible to keep a straight face.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our new route led us
through the ruins of the village of Chirbet en Nasara, then on
towards the road to Jerusalem.&nbsp; There we caught up with the
boy, noting how the mule pretty much obeyed him.&nbsp; From this
path, it was just 400 paces to Abraham&rsquo;s Well; in the corner
of the photograph, note the large, square stone wall. No one knows
why this wall exists, nor whether it was ever expanded. Now, it is
simply a rubble.&nbsp; The blocks are often five meters long, yet
they are no longer joined with mortar.&nbsp; In Baalbek, I have
seen hewn stones that are over nineteen meters in length. Given the
era of this wall&rsquo;s origin, a five meter stone was plenty to
manhandle.&nbsp; Nearby is still another cistern; it&rsquo;s called
&ldquo;The Bath of Sarah,&rdquo; Ishmael&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s
well. In the nearby rugged rocks, two oil lamps have been
affixed.&nbsp; Not far from the crumbled wall is a large church,
most likely the basilica that Constantine the Great erected at
&ldquo;The Strong Terebinth Tree of Mamre.&rdquo; To this day, this
place is called &ldquo;The Valley of Terebinth,&rdquo; a place to
search for acceptance and adoption.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we reached the
four-cornered wall, we saw a poorly clothed Arabic woman and her
small daughter sitting in a corner near the well. As soon as they
saw us, they stepped back from the water. After we dipped up some
water for our animals and gave them time to drink, my wife found a
spot to take a photograph.&nbsp; When the Donkey Driver saw her
camera, he immediately removed himself and his mules to a place of
safety&mdash;for he believed that only Christians and Jews were
able to withstand the power of photography. Every other creature,
whether man or beast, risked destruction.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peering from behind
a large stone, his curiosity drove him to see what was taking
place. He saw &ldquo;the eye of the monster,&rdquo; the lens of the
camera, which was pointed directly at me and towards the
corner.&nbsp; He wanted to make sure that this &ldquo;eye&rdquo;
did not focus on him&mdash;but a shaft of sunlight just so happened
to shine on him.&nbsp; Actually, we no longer needed him and his
mules. Since our present location was only a few hundred paces from
the road where Mustafa Bustani was supposed to wait for us, I told
him that we would just walk from here.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the photography
was finished, I paid him.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my business dealings with
other people, it&rsquo;s never been my nature nor my way to be a
stingy man who haggles over the cost of things. Extending an open
hand goes considerably further than acting like a miser. The same
is true in this land. The Donkey Driver counted the money that I
gave&nbsp; him: &ldquo;Effendi, that is too much.&rdquo; I
insisted: &ldquo;No, I gladly give you this money. You have been
friendly and polite, so you&rsquo;ve earned the
baksheesh.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Even this tip
is too much.&nbsp; Perhaps I can do still more that will justify
this baksheesh. I will not leave this area until you also
depart.&nbsp; I have nothing more to do, so nothing precludes me
from serving you further.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;We had thought
that Thar would want to take an interest in photography, but this
was not the case. More than he realized, the exotic Arabic woman
and her young daughter held a greater gravitational attraction than
the cloud-black camera. He was looking for a way to meet them. In
the way that boys do, he first meandered from a distance, then he
came ever closer to them. Suddenly, he sat down between the two and
began to talk with uncommon familiarity&mdash;as if he were an
acquaintance from long ago, or even a relative of theirs.
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I had finished
taking our photos, he brought the small girl to where my wife and I
were seated on the edge of the cistern. Her mother remained
sitting. The young girl had the most lovingly sensitive,
wholesomely healthy face, with peach-red cheeks and large grey-blue
velveteen eyes. Judging from her appearance, it seemed like some
deep and undisturbed charming riddle was miraculously working
inside of her. Like a fountain, her light brown hair flowed from
under her desert-red scarf. One of her sunburned, delicate hands
held a few long-stemmed Canterbury-bell flowers. She kept her other
hand in the thin pleats of her spotlessly clean dress. I distinctly
recall how her dainty, suntanned feet with miniature ivory nails
partly emerged from elegant leather sandals. In light of this
extraordinarily pleasant first impression of her, an endless sense
of compassion filled my heart for this girl who was as poor as she
was pretty. In my respect for her and her mother, I somehow felt
more and more compelled to be prepared to offer them some great and
suitably timely service. Later on, my wife told me that she too had
felt this instant bonding&mdash;at precisely the same
moment.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned to ask
Thar: &ldquo;Well then, what is her name?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know, but you yourself can ask her, right? In talking with her, I
learned no more than these three things: she likes me; I&rsquo;m
her hero, and I&rsquo;ll fight for her.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
called Schamah,&rdquo; she said, putting an accent on the second
syllable of her name. The fidgeting hand that formerly hid in the
pleats of her dress now directed an outstretched forefinger as she
pointed: &ldquo;Over there is my mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice
sounded soft and tender, yet strikingly moving. Its tone had a
hard-to-refuse ring. With open arms, my wife hugged the girl as she
asked me this question: &ldquo;What does the name Schamah
mean?&rdquo;&nbsp; So, I briefly explained: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
East Jordanian pronunciation of <u>Samah</u>, which means
&lsquo;forgiveness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Smiling as she talked to the child, my wife hugged her again:
&ldquo;Oh, innocently young and dear little soul, you&rsquo;ve done
nothing that requires forgiving.&rdquo; With laughter in her voice,
Schamah offered her colorful bouquet: &ldquo;I bring you
bells.&rdquo;&nbsp; She held the Canterbury-bell flowers to my
wife&rsquo;s ear and lightly shook them: &ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll
ring them. Can you hear them?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I
do.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo; Isn&rsquo;t
it so? Quite softly, faintly, gently&mdash; like the sound is
falling from heaven. When they grow up, they will be as grand as
the ones that hang in churches; then, the entire world will hear
their ringing.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thar joined in:
&ldquo;You speak of the church. Are you then a
Christian?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
I&rsquo;m a Christian,&rdquo; she nodded.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And also your mother?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;She
too.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then clapped his
hands and called out: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s beautiful! That&rsquo;s
wonderful! I&rsquo;m glad to know that!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
precisely for these reasons: I&rsquo;m a hero, and I want to put up
a good fight for your rights. No one can properly perform heroic
deeds for a Muslim girl. Unattractive as a frog, she wraps herself
in fabrics and limps around with wooden slippers on her feet.&nbsp;
By contrast, I can clearly see the Christian girl. That fact is
essential whenever heroes like us are inspired to risk our lives
for others.&nbsp; Do you know how I will look when I fight for
you?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Like you are
dressed today, right?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No.&nbsp;
What I have on now is not bold enough. Do you know that certain
colors can scare an enemy? For this reason, I put on war paint as
soon as a conflict arises. One side of my face becomes blue, and
the other side is painted green&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Phooey,
phooey, phooey!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t like that?&rdquo; he asked, halfway astonished and
partially disappointed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not at all. I
like you just the way you are&mdash;not all painted
up!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thar was pleased
with her answer: &ldquo;Good, I&rsquo;ll remain who I am. Now that
I think more about what you&rsquo;ve said, you&rsquo;re right, very
right. From now on, whenever I struggle with enemies, they may
paint themselves blue, yellow, and green&mdash;but not I.
I&rsquo;ll bear that in mind. Our four clubs must have newer and
better rules. Foremost, whoever presents himself in war paint will
be judged as beatable. To please you, I&rsquo;m ready to bound away
from all rules that are good for nothing!&rdquo; He then stretched
his legs and flexed his muscles so convincingly that her eyes
widened in wonder as she pointed to him and asked this question:
&ldquo; Yes, I already believe that you&rsquo;re a hero; but what
exactly could be a reason to knock someone down, just for my
sake?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;A cause can
always be found if you look for it. Maybe it&rsquo;s coming from
over there.&nbsp; Look!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pointed in the
direction of the church ruins, to people whom we hadn&rsquo;t
previously seen&mdash;to those who were now coming towards us.
There were ten or twelve men who were riding on donkeys.&nbsp;
Behind them was a column of&nbsp; forty or fifty armed boys who
were carrying all kinds of banners. This was one of those parades
for children who excitedly circled the city on this festival day.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a dangerous situation?&rdquo; my wife
asked. &ldquo;We should leave quickly.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My answer was one of
caution: &ldquo;Under no circumstances and in no way should we
hurry. This would merely show them that we have some reason to be
fearful, something to hide from. We&rsquo;ll freely give them the
water, but not right away. I hope they will give us some kind of
greeting.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>The procession had now arrived at our spot.
The men stopped to talk with our Donkey Driver, asking some
questions about us. They learned that we were Christians&mdash; be
that as it may, that we were not bad people. Schamah&rsquo;s mother
left her seat and came nearer to us. She feared the fanatical
people of Hebron, so she begged us to pack up and leave.&nbsp; She
was a Christian, a widow from the region called Al Karak, a city in
Jordan that contains a famous Crusader castle. It&rsquo;s located
on the other side of the Dead Sea. She and her young daughter were
on a pilgrimage to the holy cities of Bethlehem and
Jerusalem.&nbsp; Truly, she was a simple and poor woman. Still,
I&rsquo;d like to extend my impression of her; in every way, her
clothes were expressly Arabic and chic&mdash;like those customarily
worn by a Middle Eastern woman, or even by a Bedouin. Her clothing
was beautiful yet tasteful, with no suggestion of melancholy nor
fascinating glamour. She was a daughter of sorrow, not a woman of
good fortune.&nbsp; My wife extended her hand to Schamah&rsquo;s
mother, drawing her close to her side. I advised her to put aside
any concerns; nothing was going to happen to them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>The riders now came up to us. They stopped a
few feet from us and climbed down from their donkeys. It was clear
that they didn&rsquo;t intend to greet us. I couldn&rsquo;t
tolerate that sort of contempt, because such insolence involved
behavior that I wanted to bypass and avoid completely. Whenever you
want others to know that you hold a certain air of strength,
it&rsquo;s always effective to put on a special sort of image. I
crafted such a first firm impression, and it seemed to work with
the leader of the group. He shifted his weight, held his hand to
his chest, slightly bowed and said: &ldquo;<u>Salam</u>. Peace be
upon you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Those words sounded brusque. Just as curtly,
I stood my ground and answered: &ldquo;Salam.&rdquo; Before I could
say more, Thar spoke up: &ldquo;Here is my Effendi, the Supreme
Secretary of Germany&rsquo;s Chancellor. From his briefcase flows
the complete control of all tax revenue. He levies a tax on
whomever he wants. He has just returned from Hebron where he sought
to buy The Oak of Abraham from the Russians, then transport it
home. Hail to Effendi!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>After he said that, he took his new
girlfriend by the hand and went towards the boys from Hebron. Since
I was still so overwhelmed with surprise that he would meddle and
make such &nbsp;fantastic claims about me, I completely forgot to
caution him. Thank God, something unforeseen did not happen. The
men believed he was serious. They held a brief discussion, then
they all bowed deeply as Abdullah said this to me: &ldquo;Effendi,
you are a great and powerful official.&nbsp; Unfortunately, you are
also a Christian. For this reason, we are not permitted to invite
you to be our guest. The children&rsquo;s games can only begin when
you have left this site.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Indirectly, this was an invitation to leave
only our dust behind. Taking their donkeys with them, the men moved
to a more remote spot. A little more peaceable scene was taking
place where Thar and Schamah met together with the boys from
Hebron. The boys were very excited. Since so many of them were
hollering, they shouted something that we didn&rsquo;t understand.
Fearlessly, Thar stood there in front of the boys. As if protecting
the girl, he put his left arm around the girl and gestured
menacingly with his right&mdash;we could not hear what he was
saying to the crowd. Schamah&rsquo;s mother was anxious about the
safety of her daughter. I tried to reassure her. We drew closer to
the aroused and animated group.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>When Thar saw us coming, he called out to us:
&ldquo;Nothing will come of their threat. They want to drown
Schamah&mdash;in the water close to where you have been sitting.
They justify themselves by saying that she is a Christian who has
defiled today&rsquo;s festival. I told them that I won&rsquo;t
allow that, so I&rsquo;ll fight for her.&nbsp; They are now
choosing the ringleader that I&rsquo;m supposed to deal with. Ah,
there he is!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>He pointed to a tall, robust boy who now
stepped forward.&nbsp; Following the customary way that the adults
had taught him, he gave his pre-battle speech. He struck a pose and
called out to Thar, as well as to us:&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a
Christian-dog, and she is a Christian girl, which is even worse
than a cur. We will drown her in the deepest part of the well, in a
spot where she can not touch bottom. We are true, absolute, and
obedient believers of the Prophet. In this celebration of
Ishmael&rsquo;s birthday, we can not endure the sacrilege of a
Christian&rsquo;s feet to touch this ground. So, she must die. But
you want to fight for her, because you claim to be a hero. We are
game for this, because we too are heroes. I demand that you state
your conditions for combat!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>When Schamah&rsquo;s mother heard all of
this, her fear reached its peak. I explained to her that it was
probably not a case of violent rage that would actually be carried
out&mdash;rather, it would be handled as a game.&nbsp; After all,
today was supposed to be the &ldquo;Day of Children&rsquo;s
Games.&rdquo; She could rest assured that nothing would happen to
her daughter. So, it was not necessary to take her away from our
boy Thar.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Thar then spoke to Schamah: &ldquo;You are
Queen of the Games; and before your eyes, they are about to begin.
Come and be seated!&rdquo; She sat upon a stone bench, and he took
his place beside her. Next, he took his notebook from his vest
pocket, opened it, and began to deliver his counter-reply to the
ringleader: &ldquo;You call me a Christian-dog. On the contrary,
I&rsquo;m a Muslim from Jerusalem, and that is far greater that
your Hebron sect. Who then are you?&rdquo; He began to read the
following lines: &ldquo;You are all Canaanites: Hittites, Jebusites
, Girgashites, Hivites, people of Arka, Amorites, Sidonians,
Phenicians, those from Zemar, Arvadians, Hamathians, and all others
dwelling in Zidon. In the refining process of Islam, you were found
lacking and were passed over&mdash;now, you are simply sediment. If
your faith were pure and noble, then your people would not find it
so necessary to keep others away from your places of
worship!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>He returned his notebook to its vest pocket
and continued speaking: &ldquo;You say that my young girl friend is
worse than a dog. A true hero would not say such a thing. By
contrast, I&rsquo;m a hero, I&rsquo;m civil, and I oppose
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll fight with you, but not on your
terms&mdash;all of you against only me.&nbsp; Instead, we&rsquo;ll
follow the custom we practice in Jerusalem&mdash;one on one. You
will find yourselves transformed into Lions, Elephants, Hippos, and
Whales. From among you, select the boldest Lion, the most powerful
Elephant, the strongest Hippo, and the largest Whale. I will fight
all four beasts. When I defeat all four of your fighters,
I&rsquo;ll receive&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;My Canterbury-bells,&rdquo; Schamah
called out. Her small hand raised the flowers upward.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Yes, your bluebell flowers,&rdquo;
Thar chimed in. &ldquo;Palestinian Hebronites, sit down in front of
her and me, and I&rsquo;ll explain to you what all of this has to
do with Lions, Elephants, Hippos, and Whales.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>With pleasure, they immediately obeyed
him.&nbsp; For a few moments, they scurried helter-skelter,
crawling over and under each other like crazed insects.&nbsp; A
deep silence then took over, broken only by the boy&rsquo;s
clarifying voice. &nbsp;When they all grasped the picture that he
was describing, they began to cheer loudly. A thing like this had
never happened before. Everyone pressed forward, wanting to be
chosen as one of the beasts. In the midst of these
would-be-juggernauts who strove for revenge, there sat Schamah,
&ldquo;Forgiveness.&rdquo; Without any fear of harm, she kept a
peaceful smile on her loveable face. Curiously enough, the adult
men were just as excited as the boys. They all flocked around. The
Hebron men joined their boys in the process of selecting and
appointing. They marked out the fight-arena. Abdullah, who was the
Secretary of State for the Palestinian Sheik of Balad, even took it
upon himself to appoint security police as part of the rules for
this fight. What more can be said about hate and disputes among
religious people.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>The field for fighting formed four corners:
Lions to the north, Hippos to the south, Elephants to the east, and
Whales were confined to the west. Schamah sat on the southern side
of her throne, where she could easily keep her eyes on everything.
Guewerdschina the mule served as her throne, the most protected
place that remained on that site. Musicians sat in the corner: a
jar-drum, a tambourine, trumpets, and a fipple flute. If Thar were
wrestled to the ground, they were supposed to make the loudest
possible clamor. With the victory never tipping to their side, the
Hebronite musicians had no chance to play their
instruments.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>They had chosen their strongest athletes. The
competition&rsquo;s rules were very simple: the loser would be
whoever was thrown to the ground in the first three beast- matches.
The battle of the Whales would take place in the fountain. The
winner had to dunk his opponent, then publicly spew a mouth full of
water in his face. Before the matches began, the Four Heroes of
Hebron were asked whether they wanted to withdraw their names from
the competition. &ldquo;For no amount of money!&rdquo; they
replied.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Secretary of State Abdullah then gave the
signal for the battle of the Lions to begin. The Lion of Hebron
stepped forward.&nbsp; He was the same tall, robust boy who first
gave a speech. When he saw all eyes turn towards him, his face took
on an overly confident expression.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Thar stood beside us: &ldquo;Watch carefully!
See how quickly this happens. The main thing is to give your enemy
no time to think.&rdquo; He then stepped into the ring, bowed to
Schamah, and positioned himself squarely in front of his foe. No
doubt he had learned this knightly behavior from hearing some
legend, or from some fairy tale. Abdullah now clapped his hands
three times.&nbsp; In the blink of an eye, it happened. When his
opponent hesitated, Thar lunged. He let him come quite close, then
sprang to the side as he clenched the boy from behind and
completely buckled him under. Just as he had wrestled old Eppstein
down to the ground, he firmly held the young Hebron Lion as he
called out to the musicians: &ldquo;Now you can sound your notes of
triumph for him!&rdquo; &nbsp;Of course, they were silent. The
loser slowly stood up; with his head lowered, he slinked
away.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Next came the Battle of the Elephants. The
opponent was a cumbersome guy who seemed to have twice the strength
as our boy possessed. With a smile, Thar gave a nod to us. That was
a good sign. He had told us how those in the Elephant Club had to
do their trampling in unison. First here, then suddenly over there,
he didn&rsquo;t simply take the kid down&mdash;he bounced him to
the ground. When Abdullah gave the signal, Thar powerfully launched
forward, swung himself upward, and simply sprang over that heap of
a foe. In an instant, he put his knees upon the boy and called out
to the musicians: &ldquo;Loudly, loudly, &nbsp;now play your song
of triumph for him!&rdquo; All around, stillness
reigned.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Only Secretary of State Abdullah angrily
called out: &ldquo;Oh my, two are already down. This is not
acceptable. Let our Hippo come forth, and he will stomp him into
the ground. The Hippo was a short, thick rascal who was not endowed
with muscles, just a lot of fat. Fearlessly, he rolled his eyes; he
had good courage. As the time drew nearer for the start of the
match, he put his head down like a runner. Letting out a colossal
hoo-ha, the Hebron Monster then lay down on the ground and
stretched his legs into the air. He held his head with both hands
and bellowed as if someone were planning to roast him on a grill.
Thar just stood there erect; with a laugh, he teased the musicians:
&ldquo;You guys don&rsquo;t need to play your drums nor blow your
horns, because he&rsquo;s making his own music.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Now the giants of the ocean would show what
they could do. The former four sides of the ring now collapsed.
Everyone headed to the deep well, wherein the final judgment was
supposed to take place. Thar was the first to arrive at the
cistern; he stood ready to descend into the water. The Hebronites
came less quickly. Slowest of them all were the Whales. The very
last one to arrive was the guy that was supposed to fight with
Thar. With a very embarrassed look on his face, he came to the
brink of the well, then looked away as he said: &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want this job anymore!&rdquo; &nbsp;Abdullah responded:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve already accepted the position, so you must go
through with it!&rdquo;&nbsp; As the boy turned and hurried away,
he called out:&nbsp; &ldquo;Not for any amount of money! I&rsquo;m
leaving!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;So, we must choose someone
else!&rdquo; said Abdullah.&nbsp; From out of the throats of the
remaining Whales, this chorus rang out: &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t
pay me enough money! I&rsquo;m going&mdash;I&rsquo;m
leaving&mdash;I&rsquo;m out of here!&rdquo;&nbsp; One after
another, they disappeared, until there were no more to be
seen&mdash;except one in the distance. Without saying
&ldquo;adieu,&rdquo; the Lions followed those who had already left.
In much the same way, the Hippos and the musicians made the same
kind of exit. Most of the Elephants ambled off in single file, but
some left in twos and threes. Without saying a word or grudgingly
waving good-bye, the adults finally rode away.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Thar turned towards Schamah: &ldquo;Now do
you believe that I&rsquo;m a hero?&rdquo; She handed him the
Canterbury-bells: &ldquo;From the very beginning, I believed you.
You&rsquo;ve won, so here are your flowers.&rdquo; He accepted the
prize, then he gave the bouquet to my wife, asking her to take care
of them; she could do this better than he would.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>In the distance, we now saw another
considerably large procession, and it looked like it was coming our
way. With their sharply trained eyes, our adversaries had already
seen this approaching caravan. For that reason, they hurried away.
They didn&rsquo;t want their disgrace to be discovered by the
incoming crowd.&nbsp; We too no longer had a reason to stay,
because the time was drawing nearer for us to move on and keep our
appointment to meet Mustafa Bustani. &nbsp;Schamah&rsquo;s mother
said that she and her daughter were headed towards The Oak of
Abraham; from there, they wanted to travel to the Russian Hospice
and spend the night. The Arabic widow had heard that penniless
pilgrims could stay there free-of-charge. Our friendly Donkey
Driver declared that the mother and daughter didn&rsquo;t have to
walk that distance; since his return to the city would be the same
route that they were traveling, they could ride with
him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Thar heard
this, he quietly asked me: &ldquo;Effendi, do you have a 20 franc
coin?&nbsp; Please, give it to me, but don&rsquo;t let anyone see
it.&rdquo; I suspected why he wanted the money, so I said
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and secretly slipped him the coin. Schamah and
her mother climbed upon one of the mules, and the driver rode upon
another. Thar vaulted onto the back of Guewerdschina and said:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m riding with you. Once we reach the Oak,&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll walk back. Before my father arrives, I&rsquo;ll be
there.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tugged the
dove&rsquo;s tail high into the air&mdash;she let out a loud
hee-haw and shot down the road. My wife gave the widow our name and
our address in Jerusalem and invited her to make every effort to
visit us there.&nbsp; We would genuinely and whole-heartedly like
to see her and her young daughter. She promised that she would
assuredly do her best to visit us. So giving her word, she said
good-bye as they rode away and tried to catch up with Thar.&nbsp;
My wife and I then took a short walk on the surrounding area,
making sure that we avoided any further
encounters.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When we reached the rendezvous, Thar was already waiting for us:
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re so very poor. They only know that I was
concerned about them and that I wanted to accompany them to the
Hospice.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do they know
your name?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And your
father&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;No. You may
have heard that the Prophet tells us this: &lsquo;Whoever gives to
the poor should give everything&mdash;only not in the name of his
father.&rsquo; &nbsp;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll see them again in
Jerusalem.&nbsp; You can count on that.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Soon
thereafter, Mustafa Bustani arrived with the carriage. He was very
glad to hear that the local citizens did not harm us nor his son.
He shared the fact that there had been several clashes&nbsp;
between Muslims and Jews. In light of the fact that he personally
was so angry about the rude reception from his business colleague,
he had even refused to share a meal with the man. Now, he was
hungry. As soon as we climbed in and were once again moving, we
brought out the food that we had packed earlier. So, our on-the-go
evening meal&rsquo;s setting was atop four rolling wheels.
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the return home,
nothing happened that would be important enough to retell. When we
reached the Hebron Valley, we once again stopped at the
caf&eacute;. This time in a much more measured manner, the
innkeeper stepped out and asked for our orders. Mustafa Bustani
spoke up: &ldquo;Five cups of coffee!&rdquo; The drinks were served
and sipped. I then pulled out my money pouch: &ldquo;How much for
the five?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Exactly one
half franc,&rdquo; he answered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the fifteen from forenoon?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;One and a
half francs.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So,
altogether for the twenty?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Two
francs.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>I gave him
only two francs&mdash;not a fraction of a Turkish piaster more:
&ldquo;Here! Paid in full!&rdquo; He quickly gripped the money and
slipped it into his pocket.&nbsp; This time, he bowed deeply as he
sincerely said: &ldquo;Effendi, I thank you.&nbsp; You are fair as
well as wise. May your journey home be a blessed
one.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The trip was indeed
a blessed one. Mustafa was angry about the fanaticism of his fellow
believers;&nbsp; during the entire time, he had no objection to his
son&rsquo;s crush on the small Christian girl. When we reached
Bethlehem, he took a deep breath and said: &ldquo;A lot of love and
much goodness has come out of this small city, much more than any
other large and famous pilgrimage places. Today, I was rightly and
starkly reminded of my own zealot&rsquo;s mind-set.&nbsp; What have
you ever done to the people of Hebron? Not a thing! Still, they
transgressed against you. Such unkindness and injustice! What did
my own brother do to me? Nothing. Yet, I banished him, my dear
brother. I was much more unloving and far more unjust than the
Canaanites of Hebron. Now that evening is finally here, I can tell
you that thoughts of him were with me throughout the entire
afternoon.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;What was his
name?&rdquo; my wife asked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Achmed
Bustani. As you heard me say, we still kept the same family name. I
now have no greater wish than that he is still alive and that he
will find me!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you
really divide your wealth with them?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course,
immediately!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not only because I promised my dying
wife that I would do so&mdash;for me, it&rsquo;s a personal
necessity. Ever since that dream that I told you about, I&rsquo;ve
had a very strange feeling about something more that I now must be
concerned about as we make our way home. When we were outside of
Abraham&rsquo;s Well, it seemed as if some invisible thing
accompanied you when you climbed into the carriage&mdash;something
that took hold of me and now doesn&rsquo;t want to release me
again. Perhaps it&rsquo;s nothing more than realizing the wrongs
that need to be righted. Yet in a strange sense, I&rsquo;m not
anxious; instead, it makes me feel much more at ease. There&rsquo;s
a feeling of contentment. It burrows itself into me&mdash;not to
torment, but rather to put me at ease. &nbsp;Are you going to laugh
at me when I tell you something which you yourselves can not
comprehend?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;To laugh would not even occur to us!&rdquo; I answered.
&ldquo;Be confident of that!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I have the
feeling that today I shall again dream of my brother. Isn&rsquo;t
that funny?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;By no
means.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So, you
believe that this is possible?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Secretively, what do you
think?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no!&nbsp;
All too often, we men make the mistake of treating completely
natural things as if they were mystical. In the course of
today&rsquo;s events, the picture of your brother has been shoved
into your mind&rsquo;s consciousness. Until now, you have held all
of this tightly inside of you, and it&rsquo;s become even more
deeply embedded. Hence, it&rsquo;s no wonder, and indeed very
understandable, that you would dream about him as you preoccupy
yourself with your return home. Whenever we perceive something as
wonderful, be certain that in spite of all our experiences, we
misguidedly label the obvious things in nature as inconceivably
miraculous.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we now rolled on
towards Rachel&rsquo;s Tomb and to the Prophet Elijah&rsquo;s
memorial, we soon arrived in Jerusalem&mdash;at precisely the
moment when nightfall tenderly entered the Holy City. Whatever was
intended for me to learn in Hebron, I hadn&rsquo;t yet grasped it.
As we would plainly see tomorrow, this here-to-fore unknown would
turn out to be quite different and infinitely better. So it seems
that life always takes care of things. If we are somehow denied
some external, material wish, or if an unexpected grief gets in the
way of the joy we were hoping for, our ignorance does not hesitate
to quarrel with destiny. That which we were denied on the outside
may now become an inner victory. Although this last truth may not
be apparent if we oppose it like some kind of enemy, be quite
certain that it still knocks on our door.&nbsp; Usually afterwards,
we realize that we have gained life&rsquo;s less-valued, quite
inexpensive gifts that we so very much long for. Concerning the
saddle, this was also true. I was sure about my desire for it, but
my wish to own it had to rely upon earlier circumstances that were
directed otherwise. Looking back on those past events, we are most
often too short-sighted and impatient to grasp the meaning of these
things.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning, we
had barely risen and sat down to drink some coffee, when we heard a
knock on our door. Who stepped in? It was Thar. European style, he
stretched out his hand and greeted us: &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;
We gave him our thanks and approvingly saw how he was fully dressed
in fresh, spotlessly pure white clothes. &ldquo;You are probably
surprised, right?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The colors are no longer
stylish. Our lady here first spoke about heroism that is authentic
and doesn&rsquo;t need to be painted up. Since then, I&rsquo;ve
wanted to be a real hero&mdash;no artificial coloring. Secondly,
you also heard how my new girlfriend Schamah yelled out
&lsquo;Phooey!&rsquo; when I wanted to paint my body with bold
blue, green, red and yellow colors. What she said to me is worth
more than past advice you have offered.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve definitely
decided, that in the future, I&rsquo;ll lay aside the superficial
paint and only deal with things that don&rsquo;t need artificial
coloring. By the way, I&rsquo;m only here on account of Schamah. If
she and I are permitted to drink coffee, why then are your cups
bigger than ours?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He got what he
wanted, so he sat down and continued to talk: &ldquo;Next, I want
you to know that as long as Schamah stays in Jerusalem, I&rsquo;m
withdrawing from all four clubs: the Lions, the Elephants, the
Hippos, and the Whales. For this mission, I&rsquo;ve now dressed in
white in order to inform each of the clubs that I may no longer
associate with beasts&mdash;at least for the time being. Schamah is
so polite, and if I&rsquo;m not nice too, then I&rsquo;ll feel
ashamed of myself. She said &lsquo;Phooey!&rsquo; much too
readily.&nbsp; Well then, you must be aware of the fact that
she&rsquo;s coming to Jerusalem today.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;How do you
know this?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;It is part of
the conspiracy.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;So, there is
a plot?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all seriousness,
he nodded and said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is doing
the plotting?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;With whom?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;With the Donkey
Driver.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo; As of yesterday?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='margin-left:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Yes. For that secret plan, I needed
the twenty francs from you.&nbsp; Here is the</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>money that I
borrowed. Thank you.&rdquo; He took two golden ten franc coins out
of his pocket and laid them on the table. However, I didn&rsquo;t
pick them up&mdash;instead, I said: &ldquo;Before I accept the
money, I have to know what it was for.&nbsp; Instead of loaning you
the money, I gave it to you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In earnest, he said:
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken! I don&rsquo;t beg; I only borrow.
Schamah and her mother are poor, very poor.&nbsp; At times, they
don&rsquo;t have enough to eat. Without asking anyone, I came to
this conclusion. In contrast, I&rsquo;m rich, and I&rsquo;m her
friend. Thus, without their knowing, I took care of their room and
board at the Hospice. Today, the Donkey Driver is bringing them to
Jerusalem&mdash;of course, on better animals than they rode
yesterday. They still do not know that it was I who paid for these
things. When they arrive here, they won&rsquo;t go into the
city.&nbsp; Instead, they&rsquo;ll veer to the right, riding into
the Valley of Hinnom, then up the Mount of Olives towards Bethany.
At that point, they&rsquo;ll meet my friend Abd en Nom.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is Abd en
Nom?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;He is the
father of both the greatest Whale in our club and the heaviest
Hippo that ever was. He is a host to pilgrims. At the moment, his
house is completely empty, so Schamah and her mother have more room
than they really need. They&rsquo;ll also have meals there. Of
course, Schamah believes that all of this was because the Hospice
recommended them.&nbsp; Abd en Nom likes me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be
going with him as we make the preparations.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And you are
paying for all of this?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, but I
ask you not to reveal this to anyone.&nbsp; Schamah and her mother
must never know this secret.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Does your
father know?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear boy,
you know this will cost a lot of money!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He happily laughed
as he replied: &ldquo;I have it.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;From
whom?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;As he answered my question, Thar
quickly became serious again: &ldquo;From Mother&mdash;before she
died.&nbsp; She loaned me the money, and every month, I receive the
interest. &nbsp;Since Father is the trustee of her estate, he gives
me the money. I&rsquo;m not permitted to hold onto the money.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m required to spend it&mdash;not on myself, but for poor,
old, sick people who find themselves in need. That&rsquo;s the way
Mother wanted it, so Father has to allow me to spend it how I wish.
He may only counsel me if I use the money in a way that differs
from Mother&rsquo;s instructions.&nbsp; That has never happened,
because I loved my Mother. With every piaster that I spend, I think
about how she would do the same or otherwise. To be truthful,
before I borrowed the money from you, I first had to think about
what my Mother would say. Before I went to sleep that night, I
asked myself that question.&nbsp; As I awoke early this morning, I
knew in my heart that she is in complete agreement&mdash;and that
she&rsquo;s pleased about Schamah and her mother. Effendi, will you
now take back the money you loaned me?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered and slipped the
coins into my pocket. In recognition of his soul&rsquo;s goodness,
my wife poured him a second cup of coffee.&nbsp; He took a sip,
then spoke further: &ldquo;Seriously, I want to look after her. I
would like to be her guide to all of the holy sites, including
Bethlehem and anywhere else she wants to visit. Do you know why I
would do this?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Out of compassion,&rdquo; my wife
said.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Yes, I too first thought of
this.&nbsp; Yet when I reflected on my heart&rsquo;s decision, just
as I always do when I think of my Mother, it wasn&rsquo;t a feeling
of sympathy. Rather, there was something else.&nbsp; Right now,
I&rsquo;m not sure what to call it, because I&rsquo;ve never felt
this way before. It&rsquo;s almost like a duty, and yet again, it
may be more like something that I very much enjoy doing.&nbsp; Just
as you witnessed yesterday, I would do battle with the whole world
if it meant protecting Schamah and her mother.&nbsp; And yet, that
is much, much too little;&nbsp; that&rsquo;s a long, long way from
the right thing to do. I still want to think about this some
more.&nbsp; When I&rsquo;ve found the answer, I&rsquo;ll tell you.
Now, may I leave you again? There&rsquo;s something very necessary
that I must do. Remember what I said about going to the Lions, to
the Elephants, to the Hippos, to the Whales, and to Abd en Nom!
Father must know nothing about all of this.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Does he know that you went to visit
us?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend to tell him. As
you know, he has such an extraordinary affection for you;&nbsp; if
he learned that I planned to come here, you would be stuck with him
for the entire day. Well then, may Allah protect you;&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going now.&rdquo; He finished his cup of coffee, shook
our hands, opened the door, went outside, and stood still.&nbsp;
For a moment, he pondered, came inside again, then firmly closed
the door behind him. It seemed as if he had some great secret that
he wanted to entrust to us: &ldquo;I simply must ask you a
question. Don&rsquo;t you find this ridiculous? In a man&rsquo;s
own country, he is called &ldquo;The Chosen One.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>I tried to help him with the answer:
&ldquo;How did you arrive at this question?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;In my hours of vanity, I have taken
pride in this designation; but seriously,&nbsp; this title actually
irritates me.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;So, be angry!&rdquo; said my wife.
&ldquo;Your irritation is more justified than any pleasure from
that title.&rdquo; As he meditated on that advice, he looked at
her. Then he aimed his eyes on me, thoughtfully nodding: &ldquo; I
put a great deal of stock into what your wife has said. Perhaps you
don&rsquo;t? Up to this point, she has always come up with just the
right words. Now, I&rsquo;m really going to do it! May Allah
protect you!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;Hardly ten minutes after he left us,
there was a knock on the door. Who was it? His father. He asked us
to forgive him for disturbing us at such an inconvenient hour.
Something had happened which he absolutely had to share with us.
&ldquo;Did you dream something?&rdquo; I asked him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, how did you know
that?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know for
sure&mdash;I simply had a hunch.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;You guessed correctly. Just think! In
my dream, it was morning as I got out of bed and came into my
living room. There sat my brother, as real as I am standing here.
He smiled at me and said: &lsquo;I have come, and I want to see if
I should remain.&rsquo; In pure joy, I woke up. Now tell me, is
that a phenomenon, or not?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;A miracle? No, to me it is something
more like a completely natural occurrence.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;After our conversation yesterday, I
too felt comfortable about all of this.&nbsp; Yet in today&rsquo;s
awakening, instantly after the dream, a thought came to
me&mdash;almost as if this thought itself were to be the
continuation of the dream. Do you know what my brother said to me
in the previous dream I described to you?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;That he would send you a sign of his
forgiveness.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Now then, do you recall the name of
the child whom you met yesterday, the girl whom my son constantly
talks about?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Schamah, the
Forgiveness!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;My wife swiftly joined in: &ldquo;Yes,
that&rsquo;s true! That&rsquo;s exactly right! It might
be&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp; Imitating Old Jew Eppstein, I quickly
interrupted: &ldquo;Pssst!&nbsp; Still!&nbsp; Pssst!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t try to force some kind of mystery from all this.
Although &lsquo;Schamah&rsquo; means &lsquo;forgiveness,&rsquo; at
the same time, it&rsquo;s also a girl&rsquo;s name.&rdquo; Mustafa
interjected: &ldquo;But as Thar told me, the girl&rsquo;s mother
comes from the region of Al Karak, and that place is in East
Jordan, where my brother went.&rdquo;&nbsp; In order to divert him
from this subject, I asked him: &ldquo;So, did you and Thar talk
about her today?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;It was yesterday evening that we
talked. Today, he was up early, but he said practically nothing.
Whenever his thoughts are focused on his mother, he acts this way.
It&nbsp; always keeps him preoccupied as he looks for some kind of
gift he can give or a good deed that he can perform for someone.
Off he went without having anything to eat or drink for
breakfast.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Does he know that you are here with
us?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. If he knew
that he could visit you as often as he wanted, he would stay beside
you for the entire day. I must confess that his heart dearly loves
both of you. Ever since yesterday, I&rsquo;ve seen changes in him.
The young girl seems to have made an impression on him, and that
baffles me.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Surely such a riddle is not a bad
one?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Oh no, it&rsquo;s especially very
pleasant and welcome. Compared to ordinary times, I too have
changed. Yesterday was a festival; yet for me, it&rsquo;s as if the
celebration is just now happening. I feel the same joy that I felt
in my boyhood&mdash;when something long-desired finally promises to
come true. Isn&rsquo;t that strange? Isn&rsquo;t that
laughable?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not strange to me, and in
no way is it absurd. Our souls are linked to an entirely different
world than our bodies. This connection is so deeply intimate, that
no reasonably sane man would ever doubt what we call our
&lsquo;inner voices.&rsquo; Did your dream clearly focus on your
brother? Or was it merely a figure which you mistook for
him?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Truly and clearly, it was so certain
and distinct, that even in the dream I marveled at the joy I felt
in seeing him appear precisely as he looked earlier. We were so
extraordinarily similar that people often would mistake one for the
other. We had fun with that, so he would often enhance that
relationship by wearing the same clothes and by growing a beard
just like mine. On the inside, we were very different. He was
always tender , pliable, and prone to be at peace. By contrast, I
was insensitive, unsympathetic, and always ready to play the role
of lord and master. In the end, that separated us. However,
today&mdash;.&rdquo; Something inside him stopped. He walked to the
window, gazed outside and reconciled himself to what would come:
&ldquo;There lies the road to Bab en Nebi Daud, and that way goes
to Bab el Amud. For me, it&rsquo;s the same, whichever path I take.
They both lead me around the city and towards the Mount of Olives
where I will wait to learn when and how the
&lsquo;forgiveness&rdquo; will come to me. Today, I am in suspense,
and I can&rsquo;t relax. I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>He left, and I openly confess that a portion
of his suspense stayed there with us. If I were to try to attach an
artificial angle on his narration, one which differed from the view
he had just shared with us, then I would have to rearrange the tale
itself.&nbsp; The conclusion would be otherwise, even giving his
story an extra chapter of its own. For me, it all seemed to follow
a natural course of events, which was just as interesting as any
literary embellishment that his son Thar would have added. So,
I&rsquo;ll follow the examples from our brave boy Thar and simply
report the plain, unvarnished facts.&nbsp; As long as Schamah dwelt
among us, she renounced any synthetic coloring of green nor blue,
neither yellow nor red.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>That morning, we visited the Graves of the
Kings and a couple of other nearby sites. In the afternoon, we
wanted to go to Ain Kahrim<b>,</b> one of my favorite places.
However, we could not undertake this outing. Just as we were
preparing to eat our lunch, there was a third knocking at our door.
Who appeared? Schamah and her mother. We were genuinely glad to see
them, and we welcomed their noontime visit. Without hesitation, we
invited them to eat with us. The mother was a loving, good-natured,
and noble-minded woman. She had an inner pride that stemmed from
her heart&rsquo;s solemn education. In spite of her humility, she
spoke with a good deal of satisfaction about her Azerbeijan roots
and the fact that she did not come from Syria. So, as far back as
tradition stretched, her people had always been Christians. Due to
her father&rsquo;s beliefs, he was oppressed and died as a poor
army officer in Al Karah. Her husband was also very poor, but he
was blessed with all of the virtues that are necessary to merit the
attention and the love of all mankind. His name was Achmed Bustani,
and he died from a sickness of the heart, a yearning that never
stopped gnawing at him&mdash;until death delivered him from that
ceaseless longing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Achmed Bustani! Surely, you can imagine the
impact this name had on us. Just think&mdash;the brother of our
friend. As soon as the widow made this disclosure, both women
intuitively knew that they had been drawn to each other&mdash;both
outwardly and inwardly, sensing a bond of confidentiality between
them. In spite of the few short lines that I now use to report this
surprise, naturally, it took several hours for us to grasp what we
had just learned. During the time she talked with us, her
heart&rsquo;s restrained agony peered out from her moist, poignant
eyes. Not wanting to increase her sadness by asking insensitive
questions, it was especially hard for us to repress our normal
curiosity about the details.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Quite simply, Achmed Bustani died of
homesickness.&nbsp; At most, his love for his wife and child
delayed his death, but nothing could prevent his dying. Knowing the
inherent importance of very close family relationships among
Semitic people, it cost him his life when he could not bear the
thought of his father and his entire family banishing him and
forever refusing to give him their support. Practically moments
from death, he asked his wife to promise him that she and Schamah
would make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. If possible, she was to find
his brother and seek reconciliation with him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Originally, she had only wanted to hike from
Abraham&rsquo;s Oak to Bethlehem. Her plans changed at the Hospice,
where she received a slip of paper from an anonymous benefactor in
Bethany, a village on Jerusalem&rsquo;s eastern slope of Olivet.
The note assured them of free room and board in the Good
Samaritan&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; At the same time, he had arranged
for our Donkey Driver to take them to Jerusalem. From there,
someone would pick them up and accompany them&mdash;all free of
charge. It pleased her to recall the kindness of this man&rsquo;s
heart. Likewise, she was thankful for the humanitarian aid they
received in the Russian Hospice that stood near Abraham&rsquo;s
Oak. They never suspected the truth, that our &ldquo;Hero of the
Blood Feud&rdquo; was the one to whom they owed their
thanks.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>They did not go into the accursed Valley of
Hinnom where the god Moloch was once worshipped. Nor did they ride
straight to the house of their anonymous benefactor. They first
wanted to ask if we thought it was &ldquo;OK&rdquo; for two lonely,
Christian pilgrims to accept this man&rsquo;s invitation to stay in
his home. &nbsp;We gave them as much information as we could and
offered to accompany them to their host&rsquo;s house, for we too
wanted to meet this man. They gratefully accepted our offer. Just
as we were ready to depart, there was a fourth knock at our
door&mdash;in stepped our lad Thar.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>He was completely out of breath. When he saw
Schamah and her mother, he excitedly called out: &ldquo;So, what
the Donkey Driver told me is true! Instead of riding straight to
your host&rsquo;s house, you first stopped off here. But why are
you staying here longer? Why didn&rsquo;t you travel directly
towards Bethany, following the Hinnom Valley, just like I told the
Donkey Driver to do?&rdquo; He was coming close to revealing his
other identity. I placed my hand on his shirt collar and brought
him into the adjoining room: &ldquo;I believe it&rsquo;s best that
Schamah and her mother don&rsquo;t know that you and the Donkey
Driver secretly instigated this part of their visit to Jerusalem.
Are you now ready to tell everything?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp; He seemed startled: &ldquo;Allah,
Allah! You&rsquo;re right&mdash;that was dumb of me! Still, put
yourself in my shoes, Effendi. There I was with all of my Lions,
Elephants, Hippos, and Whales, standing near the Pool of Siloam as
we waited for Schamah. We were all set to provide a festive,
multi-stage-parade as we escorted her to
Bethany&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;With the Hippos and
Elephants?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Yes, of course!&rdquo; he nodded.
&ldquo;I called them all together, because I wanted them to help me
welcome my new friend with a grand reception. They all wore their
best costumes. We had decorated the entire neighborhood with
flowers. We even took branches and swept the streets of the parade
route. Upon her arrival, we had all planned to bow at the same
time. Next, Firdusi was going to recite a poem. Thereafter, it
would be my turn to give a good speech in her honor. Following
this, there would be more bows, along with a song that included
both singing and blowing our horns. Busiri&rsquo;s poem would come
next. Finally, there would be a triumphant bellowing
&lsquo;Huzzah!&rsquo; At this point, our festive procession would
begin to move&mdash;half of us ahead and half trailing. &nbsp;I
would be riding between Schamah and her mother, leading both of
their donkeys.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>I laughed as I exclaimed, &ldquo;Yes, you
planned a delightful surprise!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&nbsp; Now, imagine
how we waited for hours, yet no one came. When Schamah and her
mother separated from the Donkey Driver and rode here to your door
instead of taking the pre-arranged route, we agreed to modify our
plan. Since this thought came to the Driver later on, it was just a
few minutes ago that I realized how I might find them waiting here
at your place. I hurried here to urge you to come right
away&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want my Lions and Whales to lose
patience!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>It made me sad to know that I had to dampen
his enthusiasm, but I couldn&rsquo;t do otherwise&mdash;I had to
follow through. I shared my reasons regarding why such a grand
greeting would be impossible. Think. This would not befit a
Christian pilgrim whose inner nature is humble and modest.
Likewise, consider her reaction to hearing Islamic poems and the
bellowing whoops of your triumphant reception.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>He understood enough to see my point of view:
&ldquo;Good, Effendi. So, let&rsquo;s omit those things, but do
this instead. Do you know &ldquo;The Song of Bethany,&rdquo;
telling how Jesus came to visit his siblings?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Alright, you&rsquo;ll soon hear that
song. Are you now planning to take the road towards the Hinnom
Valley and the Pool of Siloam?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Yes, my wife will likely take a
photograph there.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Good, that works. Please travel
slowly. As for me, I&rsquo;ll rush on ahead of
you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>I wanted to admonish him not to do anything
inappropriate, but he waved me off as he hurriedly left in a cloud
of dust. We followed him; and just as I thought, my wife reminded
me to bring along the camera. She wanted to take a few pictures at
the Pool of Siloam and a couple of photos in Bethany.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>The purpose of this story is not to describe
Jerusalem and its surroundings. For that, I&rsquo;ll let the path
of our journey speak for itself. My wife&rsquo;s photographs
clearly show the location and the appearance of the Pool of Siloam.
In that photo, I&rsquo;m not dressed like an Arab; instead,
I&rsquo;m wearing European clothes and a safari hat on my head.
This partially explains the picture. According to <u>The Book of
John</u>, Chapter 9: 7, it was here that Christ healed the man who
was born blind.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>When we arrived, we saw that no one else was
there. I was glad about that. The solitude and stillness matched
the moods that we found ourselves in. As we rode along, we limited
ourselves to earnest conversations. Little Schamah acted like a
lovely inner beam of sunshine that cast its light on our
serious-minded subjects. The widow focused on the goal of her
journey. One ceaseless, important question quaked inside of her:
&ldquo;Would her pilgrimage be favorably fulfilled, or not?&rdquo;
As for us and what we already knew, we eagerly held onto our high
expectations that the moment of decision would soon come.
&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>My wife wanted&nbsp; to have her picture
taken with Schamah, but today the child did not trust the dark,
dangling three-dimensional camera&mdash;so, she declined. I alone
would have my picture taken beside the Pool. After the camera
clicked and before we left the site, she took one last, close look,
as if to memorize this part of our trip.&nbsp; Suddenly, the boys
surprised us from the right and to the left, both from above and
below, practically from all sides and from all heights where they
had hidden themselves behind the rocks. They were singing a
peculiar, two-part song in the Arabic language. It was &ldquo;The
Song of Bethany,&rdquo; when Jesus was on his way to visit brothers
and sisters, stopping along the way to heal the sick at the Pool of
Siloam. Picture our inner moods and the outer backdrop of the
scenery; all of this seemed to be waiting for us. Here too, we were
completely amazed when we heard the profoundly deep and strangely
stirring &ldquo;Song of Christ.&rdquo; That song left a lasting
impression on us, one that almost brought us to our knees as we
intently listened. Neither breath nor foot moved. The singers
remained concealed in their hiding-places&mdash;they had a good
stage director. From this moment on, I never doubted that our lad
had been born with a natural talent for art.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>From the Pool, we traveled toward Cedron, the
brook that flows between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives. We also
wanted to see the so-called upper bridge at Gethsemane. On our way
to Bethany, we passed by the Jewish burial grounds. Just outside
the village, Thar stood all alone. He was waiting for our arrival,
so he greeted us. Very softly, he asked me this question:
&ldquo;Have you seen them?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Whom?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;The singers.&nbsp; They anticipated
the time it would take for you to make the trip to Gethsemane, all
in order to be here to sing for you once more. Come! I&rsquo;ll
lead you to Abd en Nom; you&rsquo;ll want to see the living
quarters that we&rsquo;ve already reserved for Schamah. After that,
we&rsquo;ll go to Lazarus&rsquo; Tomb, and there you can take a
photograph.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>He took Schamah by the hand as they went on
ahead of us. Abd en Nom&rsquo;s house was located near the site of
Lazarus&rsquo; Grave. The owner of the house stepped outside,
bowing respectfully low as he greeted us. His two sons were there,
both of whom we recognized from Thar&rsquo;s description of them:
&ldquo;the largest Whale that we have and the strongest Hippo that
ever was.&rdquo; Both of them gave us an inspiring impression that
they were quite friendly. The little guest house certainly appeared
to be clean and cozy. It looked as if the guests would be very
satisfied with their accommodations here. When we stepped inside,
we saw that we had guessed correctly. Regarding the two rooms
prepared for Schamah and her mother, the furnishings were so
perfectly arranged that nothing more could be wished for. Besides
all this, the rooms were decorated with flowers and palm branches
that no doubt were part of the festive parade that Thar had
planned.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>Secretively, the lad gave me this
explanation: &ldquo;Since I had to hurry so much, everything here
had to be put in place very quickly.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Well now, where did you find all of
the heroes?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style='text-indent:.5in'><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&ldquo;Right away, you&rsquo;ll hear
them.&rdquo; With these words, he went to the door and motioned to
someone outside. Immediately, there arose a triumphant whoop that
was at least fifty to sixty voices strong. The pitch and tone of
this cheer were so shocking and unnatural, that all of this noise
could not have come from real lions, elephants, hippos, and whales.
&ldquo;May Allah have mercy on you!&rdquo; I called out.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough. Please stop!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>When he
beckoned with his hand, everything quieted down. Still, we
couldn&rsquo;t see where these &ldquo;beasts&rdquo; were hidden
away. &ldquo;That completes it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just one
last time, I had to let them blare. Now they&rsquo;ve had their
way, so they won&rsquo;t do it again. Well now, do we want to visit
Lazarus&rsquo; Grave where you can take some
photos?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We all agreed to go,
because the sun was already beginning to sink; if we waited any
longer, we wouldn&rsquo;t have enough daylight for a good picture.
Thar and Schamah ran on ahead, but her mother asked to stay behind.
Before it grew dark, she wanted to be sure that their rooms were
ready for night time. Her request was such a natural one, that we
fully understood her wish to remain at the house. So we went on
without her and soon caught up with the children. We positioned the
camera so that it was pointed toward the entrance of the tomb. As
far as we knew, no one was inside.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From behind a door
inside the cave, out stepped the official attendant, waving his
arms in the air and shouting at us: &ldquo;Not now! Not now! Now it
is forbidden, because a Muslim is inside, a Follower of the
Prophet!&rdquo;&nbsp; Click! He was too late; my wife had just
snapped the camera&rsquo;s shutter. In spite of our disobedience of
his orders, we were thankful to have a good picture that
illustrates this part of my narrative. Just as we were putting the
camera away, we saw the &ldquo;Believer of the Prophet&rdquo;
emerge from Lazarus&rsquo; Tomb. When he recognized us, he happily
hurried out to greet us. It was our good friend Mustafa Bustani.
&ldquo;How fitting and how right it feels that we should meet
here!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;On our way home, let&rsquo;s go
through Kafr et Tur, just like we did yesterday.&rdquo; Turning
towards his son, he asked: &ldquo;And you too?&rdquo; When he saw
Schamah, he respectfully bowed: &ldquo;And who is this small,
lovely child?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ever-widening
glistening eyes, Schamah stood there. Her petite face beamed with
pure happiness. Jumping for joy, she stretched out her tiny arms,
begging him to lift her up: &ldquo;My Daddy! My Daddy!&rdquo;
Thrilled to see him, she clapped her hands together and cried out:
&ldquo;Mother told me so! My Mother said it would happen!&rdquo;
Having no idea that this girl was his son&rsquo;s new friend, the
one Thar met just yesterday, Mustafa asked: &ldquo;Which mother?
What did she say?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;On our way to
the Grave of Lazarus, Mother told me that the Savior would
resurrect you from the dead&mdash;just as He brought Lazarus back
to life.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, you
Daddy!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mustafa turned
toward us: &ldquo;She believes I&rsquo;m her father! How strange!
Who is this child?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My name is
Schamah, the &lsquo;forgiveness,&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll find my
Mother over there in the house.&rdquo; Once again holding up her
outstretched hands, she pleaded: &ldquo;Just like you used to,
carry me in your arms as we go to her.&rdquo; His face lost its
color. White as a corpse, he retreated a few steps backward. His
voice faltered as he asked: &ldquo;Schamah&mdash;the
forgiveness?&rdquo; He directed the next question to his son:
&ldquo;Was this really the small girl from
yesterday?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it is
she,&rdquo; he nodded.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My word, oh
my word! Do you know her father&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the boy could
answer, Schamah spoke up: &ldquo;Truly, you are my Father! Your
name is Achmed Bustani. Don&rsquo;t you know me anymore? If not, I
can&rsquo;t help but cry. Lift me up and take me to
Mother!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
impossible to describe what happened next. Simultaneously, Mustafa
Bustani let out a cry and fell to his knees. He stretched out his
arms to Schamah and pulled her towards him. Nonstop, he kissed her
cheeks as he cried out: &ldquo;Schamah&mdash;Schamah&mdash;the
forgiveness!&nbsp; Just like he told me in my dream, has it
happened? These were his words:</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-family:Courier'>&lsquo;I
will send you my forgiveness&mdash; she comes here from the East.
Every day, look for her!&rsquo; I have done so, and now she has
arrived!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Schamah withdrew from his
caresses. With both arms, she pushed him away, looking him straight
in the eyes as she said this to him: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true;
it&rsquo;s not so! I like you, but you are not my Daddy. One more
time, you must go back into the Tomb in order to be fully brought
back to life.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He repeated her
request: &ldquo;Yet one more time back inside the Grave? Yes, I
clearly understand. There is still something inside of me that must
die. Until then and for the time being, I am your daddy&rsquo;s
brother. &nbsp;Oh dear, dear child of my heart&mdash;from now on,
you have my love, just as if I were your father.&rdquo; She smiled
when she answered: &ldquo;If you wish, then I&rsquo;ll do so. Now,
carry me to my Mother!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;First, please
tell me something else.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know
the date when your daddy died?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes,
Mother and I certainly remember that day. I can never forget that
date, because she recalls it so often. He died on the fifteenth day
of the Month of Adar, one day after the Jewish Holiday of
Purim.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mustafa leaped to
his feet. His face took on an indescribable expression: &ldquo;Did
you hear what she just said? The 15<sup>th</sup> day of Adar!
That&rsquo;s the same day of my dream. He told me that he had died
and that he would send me his Schamah, his forgiveness. Allah,
Allah! How wonderful all of this has turned out. I honor you. I
treasure you. I adore you.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;To Mommy, to
Mommy!&rdquo; pleaded the child. What she saw and heard were all
too much for her to understand just now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gathered Schamah
into his arms and lifted her up: &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll take you to
your mother. Where will we find her?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinging close to my
side, Thar was ready to go with them: &ldquo;At the home of Abd en
Nom.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still full of
excitement, his father took almost hesitant steps in the direction
of the house&mdash;where he soon vanished inside.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thar thoughtfully
pondered aloud: &ldquo;If I may not go inside and hear what is
said, I&rsquo;ll just have to speculate on what&rsquo;s taking
place. Father is right; marvelous things still happen. I myself
played a big part in today&rsquo;s miracle. Without my father
knowing, the Donkey Driver and I came up with the plan that
involved a note which would eventually lead Schamah to this
place&mdash;and at this time. Effendi, you and your wife have to
agree that all of this could not have turned out any better. Wait
for me here! As soon as I put all of this together, I&rsquo;ll ask
you to hear me out.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then left us. My
wife and I went on to visit the ruins where we quietly shared our
thoughts, almost as if we were in a church. We were completely
alone. The site&rsquo;s guardian had already gone for the day. The
entrance to the Tomb lay open. Oh what thoughts seemed to come
forth from that wide-open door. Daylight began to wane. Oh what a
pure and clean breath of fresh air drifted down on us from the
heights of the Mount of Olives. Inside of me, I heard
something&mdash;or was it from somewhere outside? Was someone
standing behind us?&nbsp; No human presence could compare to this
feeling of a powerful force that embraced us as it seemed to call
out: &ldquo;Lazarus, come out!&rdquo; Yes, nothing is so surreal as
the physical association with miracles that seems to connect the
dead with the living.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;From somewhere
up above, softly sublime and aerial two-part harmony voices floated
down to us&mdash;once again, the boys were singing &ldquo;The Song
of Bethany,&rdquo; recalling how the Savior went to visit His
brothers and sisters. Per Thar&rsquo;s instructions, the boys had
climbed behind the ruins and were now repeating the verses they had
sung at the Pool of Siloam. It was the song of Christ, the one who
caused the blind to see and the dead to live again. As I thought
about this song, it almost seemed irreverent and profane to use
common words to allude to matters of blindness and death. Such
things are deeply rooted in feelings. Herein, I can&rsquo;t
instruct you&mdash; I can only tell my story.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the song faded
away like an evening vesper from the time of Christ, Thar returned
to us. He and his playmates had parted ways, and each had returned
home. Once again, his father came out of the house. His
sister-in-law and Schamah accompanied him. When I saw their
expressions, these biblical words came to mind: &ldquo;And their
faces glistened brilliantly.&rdquo; Thar saw it too: &ldquo;What an
hour, what a blessed time,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Adding in the
song, who could have arranged all this?&rdquo; I asked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pointing to himself
with both hands, the boy answered: &ldquo;I was the
one.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you
really the one who&rsquo;s responsible? To me, it seemed as if this
was some sort of greeting from your mother.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The widow joined in:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also from my departed husband whose life ended,
yet his spirit lives on as his dying wish now comes to
fulfillment.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mustafa Bustani turned to his son: &ldquo;If all of this truly came
about through your mother&rsquo;s and my brother&rsquo;s last
requests&mdash;and not from you&mdash;surely you have done more
than your share, and you deserve our thanks. Actually, Abd en Nom
told us the name of the architect who orchestrated today&rsquo;s
joint-ventures. The compassion which your mother planted in your
young soul has born fruit and brought blessings upon us. Schamah,
the forgiveness, will be living with us
and&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;In our
house?&rdquo; Thar quickly asked.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;With her
mother?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;For how
long?&rsquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope it
will be forever.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon hearing that,
Thar shouted and leaped higher in the air than he ever had before:
&ldquo;Right away, I must hurry to tell them that they&rsquo;e
coming!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whom?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, all of
our household: Habakek, Bem, his wife, the coffee grinder, and our
cook.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We still have
plenty of time,&nbsp; because my sister-in-law will spend this
evening here with Abd en Nom.&nbsp; After all the preparations are
in place to welcome them with a festival, we&rsquo;ll pick them up
tomorrow.&rdquo; With a second joyful leap, Thar cheered:
&ldquo;Their reception will be wildly festive! May I invite my
Lions and my Elephants?&rdquo; From the look on Mustafa&rsquo;s
face, he didn&rsquo;t approve. When my wife waved her appeal to
him, he gave in: &ldquo;Yes, invite them.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Hippos
too?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;And the
Whales?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, they can
also come. They can sit in the backyard and be entertained
there&mdash;but quietly. Before they leave this evening, please
have them sing &ldquo;The Song of Bethany.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Halleluja! My
dearest and loving father, thank you. I&rsquo;ll hurry to tell them
right away!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mustafa Bustani
tried to hold him back: &ldquo;Why this very
minute?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I
still have time to catch up with them. They left just a short while
ago.&rdquo; He pulled away, quickly shook Schamah&rsquo;s little
hand, and sprang to his feet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she adoringly
watched the boy, Schamah asked: &ldquo;Will I be staying with
him?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, you
will,&rdquo; her mother answered. From now on, you two will be
together.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I too want it
to be so. I&rsquo;m very glad about that, because I love him
so&mdash;such heroes need someone to keep an eye on them. But for
now, I&rsquo;m tired from the long journey. May I soon go to
sleep?&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schamah&rsquo;s
desire to sleep now gave us a timely reason to say &ldquo;Good
night&rdquo; as well. When we also said &ldquo;Auf
Wiedersehen,&rdquo; truly we could eagerly look forward to seeing
everyone tomorrow. One more time before nightfall, mother and
daughter went to Lazarus&rsquo; Tomb as they performed a very
personal duty which the Grave now seemed to give way
to.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My wife, Mustafa Bustani, and I departed too, climbing the steep
and familiar path to Bethpage and on towards Kafr et Tur. When we
reached the height&rsquo;s Bread-bush of Jonathan, we paused for
awhile. Now in the grasp of the distant horizon, the sun sank, then
vanished. With its last beams of light, the sun embraced the
earth&rsquo;s most holy city. Unless you yourself see and feel this
marvelous sight that Jerusalem and The Mount of Olives offer at
sunset, I can not describe its wondrous beauty. We stood there for
a long time, completely absorbed in this vista.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mustafa Bustani took
a deep breath before he spoke: &ldquo;Compared to this same time
yesterday, it&rsquo;s even more beautiful, a thousand times
lovelier. You know, this kind of deep appreciation comes from
inside of us. I&rsquo;m a completely different man than I was
yesterday&mdash;I feel and I see things in an entirely better
light. There is a world of difference between yesterday and today.
I know that you don&rsquo;t expect me to talk for hours about
events and my personal feelings. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;OK&rdquo; with
you when I feel the need to be silent. Please, go on without me.
Leave me here, alone with my thoughts and alone with the brother
who forgave me today&mdash;even though I once disowned
him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So my wife and I
went on without him. As we reached the next bend in the road, the
evening bells of the Holy City began to ring. An undulating sea of
sacred music rose up to capture us&mdash;as if it wanted to take us
towards heaven. When we looked behind us, we saw Mustafa Bustani on
his knees&mdash;as church bells pealed, this Muslim was praying.
Can I say more? No.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=
'font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For those readers
who can not tolerate gaps in stories, I&rsquo;ll tell you that I
eventually received the Pasha-saddle. Mustafa Bustani made it all
possible, and I believe he did so with a great deal of personal
sacrifice. Even though this showpiece may seem to be an impractical
item in my home, I nevertheless love and treasure it. It reminds me
of those two days in the Holy Land when Thar, Schamah, the
&ldquo;blood feud,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the forgiveness,&rdquo; all
combined to send me a sign from above. I shall never forget
that.</span></p>
